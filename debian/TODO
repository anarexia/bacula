* Make sure btraceback can be found in /usr/lib/bacula

* Verify upgrades work as expected

* Bacula-SD
	- Offer menu "which 'flavor' are you running?"
	- Use update-alternatives to set a link from /usr/sbin/bscan
	to /usr/lib/bacula/bscan.$flavor

* look at installed bins and make sure we've got 'em all
* Ditto for scripts

* Give encoding on Debian DB create pgsql
  Set datestyle on debian db create pgsql

* Maybe:
  
  Remove old AUTHFILE=`getent passwd bacula | cut -d ':' -f 6`/.pgpass
  and $AUTHFILE.bak

* Make SQLite&sqlite3 purge actually remove the DB like the debconf questions
  say it will
 
* Should we zap old debconf stuff on install of the new version?

* Need a MySQL preinst?
