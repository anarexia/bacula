<jgoerzen@complete.org>.

It was downloaded from http://www.bacula.org

Upstream Authors: Kern Sibbald <kerns@users.sourceforge.net> and John Walker.

History:
The original Bacula code was Copyright Kern Sibbald and John Walker.
After November 2004, it became Copyright Kern Sibbald, and finally,
the copyright was transferred to the Free Software Foundation Europe
on 15 November 2006.

Trademark:
The name Bacula is a registered trademark.

===================================

License:
For the most part, Bacula is licensed under the GPL version 2
this code is listed under Copyright Free Software Foundation
Europe e.V. A small part of the code (less than 20 files) is
copyrighted under the GPL by other people (FSF, Sun, ...). 

What follows is information from the authors of the code:

Linking: 
Bacula may be linked with any libraries permitted under the GPL.
However, if configured with encryption Bacula does use the
OpenSSL libraries which are, unfortunately, not compatible with
GPL v2.  To the best of our knowledge these libaries are not
distributed with Bacula code because they are shared objects, and
as such there is no conflict with the GPL according what I (Kern)
understand in talking to FSFE, and in any case, for the code that
I have written, I have no problems linking in OpenSSL (of course
this does not speak for the few files in Bacula that are
copyrighted by others).  If you take a more severe stance on this
issue, and you are going to distribute Bacula, then simply do not
use the --with-openssl when building your package, and no use of
OpenSSL even through dynamic linking will be included.
             

IP rights:
Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the

sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.

Windows:
Certain source code used to build the Windows version of the
Bacula File daemon is copyrighted and or trademarked by Microsoft
and may contain Microsoft intellectual property (examples:
Microsoft VC++, the source to the VSS libraries, the Microsoft C
runtime libraries).  As such we cannot and do not distribute that
software.  We are permitted however to distribut Bacula with the
necessary Microsoft libraries in binary form.

You may obtain the parts that we cannot distribute as follows.  The
Microsoft compiler available for purchase, and Microsoft provides a free
version of the compiler.  The source code and libraries are available for
download from Microsoft public Web servers.  We have documented in the
src/win32 directory the URLs from which we obtained the library source, and
how we build the Windows File daemon and many users have succeeded in doing
so themselves.  Our intention is to respect as closely as possible Open
Source practices while maintaining full respect for proprietary and
copyrighted code.

=====================================

Bacula can be enabled with data encryption and/or communications
encryption. If this is the case, you will be including OpenSSL code that
that contains cryptographic software written by Eric Young
(eay@cryptsoft.com) and also software written by Tim Hudson
(tjh@cryptsoft.com).

There are parts of Bacula that are licensed under the LGPL so
that they may be used in proprietary code to interface with
Bacula.

Finally there are parts of Bacula that are in the public domain.
