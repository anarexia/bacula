It was downloaded from http://www.bacula.org

Upstream Authors: Kern Sibbald <kerns@users.sourceforge.net> and John Walker.

History:
The original Bacula code was Copyright Kern Sibbald and John Walker.
After November 2004, it became Copyright Kern Sibbald, and finally,
the copyright was transferred to the Free Software Foundation Europe
on 15 November 2006.

Trademark:
The name Bacula is a registered trademark of Kern Sibbald.

===================================

License:
For the most part, Bacula is licensed under the GPL version 2
this code is listed under Copyright Free Software Foundation
Europe e.V. A small part of the code (less than 10 files) is
copyrighted under the GPL by FSF, or under BSD licenses by various
authors (see below).

What follows is information from the authors of the code:

Linking: 
Bacula may be linked with any libraries permitted under the GPL.
However, if configured with encryption, Bacula does use the
OpenSSL libraries, and the OpenSSL license is not compatible with
GPL v2.  To the best of our knowledge these libraries are not
distributed with Bacula code because they are shared objects, and
as such there is no conflict with the GPL according what I (Kern)
understand in talking to FSFE.  In any case, for the code that
I have written, I have no problems linking in OpenSSL (of course
this does not speak for the few files in Bacula that are
copyrighted by others).  If you take a more severe stance on the
issue of dynamic linking to OpenSSL, and you are going to
distribute Bacula, then simply do not use the --with-openssl when
building your package, and Bacula will not use OpenSSL.
             

IP rights:
Recipient understands that although each Contributor to Bacula
grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no
assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does
not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of
any other entity.  Each Contributor disclaims any liability to
Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on
infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise.  As a
condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted
hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to
secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any.
For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow
Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's
responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the
Program.

Copyrights:
Each Contributor to Bacula represents that to its knowledge it has
sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.

Code falling under the above conditions will be marked as follows:

Windows:
Certain source code used to build the Windows version of the
Bacula File daemon is copyrighted and or trademarked by Microsoft
and may contain Microsoft intellectual property (examples:
Microsoft VC++, the source to the VSS libraries, the Microsoft C
runtime libraries).  As such we cannot and do not distribute that
software in source form.  We are permitted however to distribute
Bacula with the necessary Microsoft libraries in binary form.

You may obtain the parts that we cannot distribute as follows: The
Microsoft compiler available for purchase, and Microsoft provides a free
version of the compiler (note, we do not use the Microsoft compiler, but
rather build the Bacula Win32 client using g++ cross compiling on Linux).
The Microsoft source code that we use in the Win32 Bacula Client (Volume
Shadow Copy interface) is available for download from Microsoft public
Web servers.  We have documented in the src/win32 directory the URLs from
which we obtained the library source, and how we build the Windows File
daemon and many users have succeeded in doing so themselves.  Our
intention is to respect as closely as possible Open Source practices
while maintaining full respect for proprietary and copyrighted code.

BSD code used in the Windows version only:
Code falling under the BSD license has the following license:
