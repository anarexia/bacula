brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
property rights or otherwise.  As a condition to exercising the rights

Windows:
Certain source code used to build the Windows version of the
Bacula File daemon is copyrighted and or trademarked by Microsoft
and may contain Microsoft intellectual property (examples:
Microsoft VC++, the source to the VSS libraries, the Microsoft C
runtime libraries).  As such we cannot and do not distribute that
software.  We are permitted however to distribute Bacula with the
necessary Microsoft libraries in binary form.

You may obtain the parts that we cannot distribute as follows.  The
Microsoft compiler available for purchase, and Microsoft provides a free
version of the compiler.  The source code and libraries are available for
download from Microsoft public Web servers.  We have documented in the
src/win32 directory the URLs from which we obtained the library source, and
how we build the Windows File daemon and many users have succeeded in doing
so themselves.  Our intention is to respect as closely as possible Open
Source practices while maintaining full respect for proprietary and
copyrighted code.
