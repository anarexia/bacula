Description: Network backup, recovery and verification (Meta-package)
 Bacula is a set of computer programs that permit you (or the system
 administrator) to manage backup, recovery and verification of computer data
 across a network of computer of different kinds.
 .
 Bacula is relatively easy to use and efficient, while offering many advanced
 storage management features that make it easy to find and recover lost or
 damaged files. Due to its modular design, Bacula is scalable from small single 
 computer systems to systems consisting of hundreds of computers located over 
 a large network.
 .
 This meta-package provides the entire suite of bacula applications:
 job scheduling, storage control, node connector, and administrative console.
