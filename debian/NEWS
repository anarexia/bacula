bacula (1.38.9-3) unstable; urgency=low

 * Welcome to the 1.38 series of Bacula.

   This version of Bacula in Debian introduces some significant changes in the 
   Debian packages.  PostgreSQL director packages and MySQL packages
   have already switched to using dbconfig-common.  And new Sqlite3
   packages are available.

   Known bugs:
    * The PostgreSQL director packages currently are not properly
      setting the encoding or date format when creating a new
      database.  Upgrades are fine.  This is due to limitations
      in dbconfig-common, but those are being worked on.
