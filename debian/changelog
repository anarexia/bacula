bacula (1.38.9-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Sanitize multi-variant deps with virtual packages

    this patch upstream.  Closes: #363151.

  * Fix bacula-director-sqlite postinst to properly handle the upgrade
    to 1.38.

  * Added missing scripts disk-changer and dvd-handler to bacula-sd.

  * Removed cruft in debian/additions and debian/patches.

  * Revert changes to:
    + grant_postgresql_privileges.in (no longer necessary)
    + gnome2-console/console.c (should respect upstream syntax choices)
    + update_mysql_tables_6_to_7, 7_to_8 (irrelevant)
    + update_sqlite_tables_7_to_8 (gratuitous)

  * Thanks to new support in dbconfig-common 1.8.13, the encoding for
    the PostgreSQL database can now be specified.  PostgreSQL encoding
    should therefore be fixed.

  * Removed obsolete per-arch build code from rules.

 -- John Goerzen <jgoerzen@complete.org>  Fri, 12 May 2006 08:50:19 -0500

bacula (1.38.9-3) unstable; urgency=low

 -- John Goerzen <jgoerzen@complete.org>  Thu, 11 May 2006 06:45:44 -0500

bacula (1.38.9-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Sanitize dependencies in control -- make sure everything that

    bacula-client.

  * Reverse direction of /var/log/bacula/log symlink to have main
    logfile written in /var/log/bacula.

  * Install upstream's default logrotate (with Debian's path).
    Previously, there was no logrotate installed by default.
    Closes: #309675.

  * Removed duplicate user-adding code from bacula-director-common.
    bacula-common already does this.

  * Removed spurious chown/chmod of /var/run/bacula from bacula-sd
    and bacula-fd.  bacula-common already does this.

  * Moved chmod/chown of /var/lib/bacula and /var/log/bacula
    from bacula-director-common to bacula-common.  These areas may be
    used by non-director packages as well.

  * Switched to dbconfig-common for PostgreSQL.  Closes: #365096.
  
  * Removed large amounts of old code for PostgreSQL support.

bacula (1.38.9-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New maintainer: John Goerzen <jgoerzen@complete.org>.
    Closes: #366625.
    Thanks to Jose Luis Tallon for initially packaging and maintaining
    Bacula in Debian.

  * Close bugs that have been fixed in my earlier NMUs.
    Closes: #322753, #335809, #343762, #326175, #309601, #305220, #329271.
    Closes: #326178, #312329, #303456, #339341, #339322, #281957, #331757.
    Closes: #358762, #357619, #337250, #337376, #346430, #314492, #303862.
    Closes: #339084.

  * Examine all diffs to upstream and revert ones that are not
    (any longer) necessary.

  * Revert diff to db.m4 -- Bacula is now aware of pg_config natively.

  * Removed commented-out patching/unpatching code in debian/rules

  * Removed obsolete patch files debian/patches/*.patches,
    debian/patches/*old.  These were only referenced by commented-out
    code in debian/rules.

  * Revert patch to dbd_find.c -- no apparent reason existed for
    the change.

  * Reverted hack to comment in update_mysql_tables_6_to_7

  * Reverted hack to configure checking on syntax

  * Renamed bacula-wxconsole to bacula-console-wx to maintain a
    sane naming scheme.  Closes: #326177.

  * Removed commented-out bacula-doc section from debian/control.

  * Build-depends on mtx.

  * Removed commented-out build-depends-indep for docs.

  * Rewrote debian/rules build system -- now uses suggested vim-like 
    build system.  It calls configure several times and builds the
    package for each DB, rather than trying to hack the configure
    system to short-circuit that.

  * Use stock make_catalog_backup/delete_catalog_backup scripts,
    and move these into the per-db bacula-director-* packages.

  * Now build Sqlite3 packages (in addition to existing Sqlite v2
    packages) and make them the default.

  * Fix sqlite build-deps.  Previous versions build-dep'd on sqlite3
    but built using sqlite2.

  * No longer rename consoles in rules.

  * Update standards-version to 3.7.0.
  
  * Clean target removes config.log

  * Move bcopy and bscan manpages into proper bacula-sd-*sql* packages

  * Added missing debconf dependencies to the bacula director packages

  * Added missing adduser dependency to bacula-director-common

  * Fixed menu files for correct location of console files

bacula (1.38.9-0.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * No longer rm -rf /var/lib/bacula in bacula-director-common postinst.
    Other Bacula packages may still be installed, and this breaks them.
  * Include bwild and bregex in bacula-director-* packages.

 -- John Goerzen <jgoerzen@complete.org>  Tue,  9 May 2006 08:45:28 -0500

bacula (1.38.9-0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release: 1.38.9, which is mostly a bugfix release.

 -- John Goerzen <jgoerzen@complete.org>  Mon,  8 May 2006 10:50:45 -0500

bacula (1.38.8-0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer upload by John Goerzen.
  * Add missing build-deps: libgnomeui-dev, libx11-dev.
  * Commented out code that attempts to patch pg_hba.conf.  This sort of
    thing should never be done without prompting the user.  It was broken
    for sid as written, and also failed to take into account the
    possibility of Unix domain sockets or having multiple versions of
    PostgreSQL on a machine.  Closes: #309601.
  * Build-Conflicts on python2.2-dev.  The configure script will use it
    by default, instead of python2.3-dev, if it's available.  This could
    lead to different Python versions being linked in on different archs.
  * Numerous fixes to clean target to make sure all sorts of otherwise-missed
    generated files get removed.
  * Removed spurious chown of /var/lib/bacula in 
    bacula-director-common.preinst.  Having it there could lead to 
    failure to install that package since that directory may not already
    exist.  postinst for that package was already doing the same chown
    anyway.
  * Removed erreneous chown attempt of /var/log/bacula/log in
    bacula-director-common.postinst.  This file is not installed
    by this package.  Closes: #303862.
  * Fixed distribution of bscan and bcopy such that they appear in their
    bacula-sd-* properly, and not in bacula-director or bacula-sd.
  * debian/rules contains bashisms and will not build if bash is not
    the default shell.  Explicitly set SHELL in debian/rules.

  * The below changes were made available by Jose Luis Tallon on SourceForge.

  * New upstream version (Closes: #339322)

  * bacula-director-pgqsl: 
    - purge debconf data on purge (Closes: #314492)
    - rebuild -- update postgresql-client dependency (Closes: #339341)

  * bacula-sd
    - Solves problem w/ Linux2.6 and no tapes on startup (Closes: #337376)
    - Better handling of auto-labels (Closes: #322753)

  * GUI
    - bacula-wxconsole: Link against GNOME2 libs only (Closes: #326178)
    - bacula-console-gnome: provide desktop entry (Closes: #326175)

    - save .pgpass with user/pass, for secure use by bacula scripts,
      package upgrades

bacula (1.34.6-2) unstable; urgency=high

  * Urgency high because the PostgreSQL "flavor" is not properly built.
    It is linked against the "internal" database, which is not functional.
    - The flag to enable PostgreSQL is called "HAVE_POSTGRESQL" instead of
      HAVE_PGSQL -- Reported by E Zanardi <ezanard@debian.org>
    - Newer libpq needs -lssl -lcrypto...

    - succeed when catalog is already up-to-date (Closes: #271998)
    - work when admin user has a non-blank password.

  * bacula-director-pgsql: fixed problem, where --regardless of specified
    dbadmin-- root was used to connect to PgSQL (Closes: #272181)

    termination in init.d script (Closes: #271579)

  * Integrated some more of PMHahn build enhancements. Thanks!

  * Properly building the static bscan "flavors" brings in 
    many build dependencies..ggrrrr
    ( libpq depends on libkrb5, libk5crypto, libcom_err, libcrypt,... )

  * Corrected some more typos
    - Missing cleanup after building "flavored" binaries
    - Missing 'btraceback' component

  * Package sponsored by Roberto Lumbreras <rover@debian.org>

bacula (1.34.6-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New upstream version
  * Applied patch to avoid deadlocks in bacula-dir (urgency -> high)

  * Several cleanups from both Philipp M Hahn & Filip Van Raemdonck. I can't
    sufficiently express my gratitude here. Thanks!!
    - fixed upgrade support
    - build improvements
    - several minor fixups/reorganization. I hope i got it right this time..

  * Now bscan is a set of 3 statically-linked binaries, so that bacula-sd
    does not pull all three client libs. This had been pending for a long time...

  * Some more minor improvements
    - Logfiles are already in /var/log/bacula/ (Closes: #254245)
    - Fixed perms on /var/log/bacula/log (Closes: #252410)

  * Bacula's GNOME console was already linked against v2 libs 
    since 1.34.5-1 (Closes: #264975)

  * MySQL flavor's postinst issues
    - Wrong ordering of db_get / assignment (Closes: #270329)
    - Split line changes meaning, other cleanups (Closes: #270197)

    - FR (Closes: #269958)
    - JA, by Hideki Yamane <henrich@samba.gr.jp> (Closes: #270765)

  * Debconf-related fixes:
    - Updated versioned dependency w/Debconf: v1.4.30 seems to work.
    - Reset password's "seen" flag, so that it gets asked again
    - Moved root password question back to 'config' grr...

    Matthew Hawkins has provided invaluable feedback here. Thanks!!!

  * The "fix all those typos" release.
    - Shin-young Yune: -director-pgsql.postinst
    - typos in -director-{my,pg}sql 's postinst scripts
    - typos in dh_link commands to get manpages installed

  * Misc fixes
    - /var/lib/bacula absent from -director-common (Closes: #270196)

bacula (1.34.5-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * Urgency high, because:
    - TLS libraries from libc6-i686 no longer break bacula. (Closes: #250351)

  * New upstream version (Closes: #242725, #242735)
    - Supports PostgreSQL for the catalog (Closes: #252244)
    - Supports backup to disk.
    - Supports backing up ACLs (enabled in this package)
    - Several minor bugfixes since 1.34.2

  * Completely redone, much more efficient, build system. Contributed by
    Turbo Fredriksson <turbo@debian.org> and adapted by me: now only the
    "flavor-dependent"(cats,dird,tools) are rebuilt, instead of the full
    package. The scripts are also generated from 'rules' instead.

  * Several upstream enhancements/changes;
    + Database schema changes: `postinst' will try to upgrade MySQL & SQLite
    + Added PostgreSQL support for the catalog
    + Added support for disk-based backups, etc (see Documentation)

  * Security related changes
    - More secure password handling in configure/postinst (prompt during postinst,
    delete password inmediately) -- breaks unattended installs unless one
    uses debconf seeding, sorry; Warnings with lintian/linda, grrr...
    - Added TCP wrappers(libwrap) support, after agreement with
    Steve Smith (Closes: #245626)
    - Ensured proper ownership and permissions for /var/lib/bacula, in order
    for the PostgreSQL port to run securely.

  * Upgrade to compiling/linking the console against Gnome2;
    renamed to bconsole-gnome to avoid namespace pollution (Closes: #246953)

  * Added wxWindows console version, bacula-wxconsole.

  * Moved bcopy,bls,bextract,bscan,btape manpages to sect 8 - lintian's advice.
    - Fix minor error in bconsole's displayed usage (Closes: #254427)

  * Include bscan.sqlite, bscan.mysql, bscan.pgsql in bacula-sd, under /usr/lib
  so that data recovery can be attempted with the supplied package in the event
  that the catalog gets damaged; As politely asked by Christof Lehmann, and
  later by Tilo Levante (Closes: #255059)

  * PostgreSQL port of the maintainer scripts, merged from contributions by
    Alvaro Hernandez Tortosa <aht@ahtech.net> and
    Philipp Matthias Hahn <pmhahn@debian.org>. Many thanks!.

  * Merged enhancements/patches by PMHahn: PgSQL support, docs, 
    maint. scripts, debian/rules. I owe you one.

  * Added pt_BR translation, by <andrelop@debian.org> (Closes: #254110)

  * Misc minor bugfixes:
    - Restart breakage if not running (Closes: #252360)
    - Fixed wrong paths in scripts: added "flavor-independent" catalog backup
      script for bacula-sd (Closes: #250863)
    - Depend on exim4|mail-transport-agent (Closes: #255340)

bacula (1.32f-4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Do *not* depend on OpenSSL, since it is not really needed, as confirmed
    by upstream.

  * Increase robustnes in bacula-director-mysql's postinst: succeed

        - bacula (1.32f-3-1)	28 Jan 2004

         * Fixed a typo in bacula-director-mysql, which made postinst stomp on
           existing configuration file. Noticed by Dick Middleton.
           Robustness features in bacula-director-mysql.postinst.

         * Slightly better manpages.

         * Readied for first upload to Debian's archive.

        - bacula (1.32b-5)	24 Dec 2003

          * Completely revamped the bacula-director-mysql postinst, based
            upon suggestions/debugging by Frank Lenaerts.

            Lenaerts.

          * Verified dependencies, loosened a bit so that backporting is easier.
