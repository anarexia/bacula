bacula (2.4.2-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * Fix sed pattern in debian/rules to correctly remove
    'USE ${db_name};' from the MySQL command tables.  This prevented
    bacula-director-mysql from being installed properly and was thus RC.
    Closes: #441995, #489578.
  * While investigating the above problem, also discovered 'USE bacula;'
    statements in some upgrade tables.  This would cause the upgrade of
    bacula-director-mysql to fail for anyone that had their MySQL
    database named something other than "bacula".  Added pattern to fix this.
  * New upstream release is a bugfix release, and fixes these issues:
    + 2.4.1 included an unintentional debug statement whose purpose
      was to crash the storage daemon.  This was triggered during a restore
      at the end of a tape.  Fixed in 2.4.2 (upstream bug 1125).  When the
      SD is crashed, no backups or restores can be performed until it is
      restarted.
    + During a multi-tape restore, Bacula could incorrectly attempt
      to reread the same tape.  (Upstream bug 1126)
    + bcopy no longer reads too many records (upstream bug 1107)
    + Now sets a large timeout on MySQL databases to prevent trouble
      with the connection timining out before data gets inserted.  
      Upstream bug 1034.
    + There are also some other minor bugfixes and win32 changes upstream
      in this release, which of course don't impact Debian.

bacula (1.38.9-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * bacula-sd-*: added conflict on bacula-sd < 1.38.9, since some
    manpages have moved around since that version and conflicts
    could exist on upgrade.  Closes: #367075.
  * Removed accidentally-copied bacula-director-pgsql.preinst.
    Closes: #367066, #367069, #367070.

bacula (1.38.9-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Sanitize multi-variant deps with virtual packages

  * Move bwild and bregex into bacula-director-common instead of all
    the bacula-director-* packages.  Change bacula-director-common
    from arch all to arch any.

  * Changed all URLs from html-manual to rel-manual, and forwarded
    this patch upstream.  Closes: #363151.

  * Fix bacula-director-sqlite postinst to properly handle the upgrade
    to 1.38.

  * Added missing scripts disk-changer and dvd-handler to bacula-sd.

  * Removed cruft in debian/additions and debian/patches.

  * Revert changes to:
    + grant_postgresql_privileges.in (no longer necessary)
    + gnome2-console/console.c (should respect upstream syntax choices)
    + update_mysql_tables_6_to_7, 7_to_8 (irrelevant)
    + update_sqlite_tables_7_to_8 (gratuitous)

  * Thanks to new support in dbconfig-common 1.8.13, the encoding for
    the PostgreSQL database can now be specified.  PostgreSQL encoding
    should therefore be fixed.

  * Removed obsolete per-arch build code from rules.

 -- John Goerzen <jgoerzen@complete.org>  Fri, 12 May 2006 08:50:19 -0500

bacula (1.38.9-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Clean up Sqlite3 postinst

  * Switched MySQL to use dbconfig-common.  Removed largs amounts of
    old code for MySQL support.  Closes: #338884, #357386.

  * No longer force removal of director conffiles on removal (only
    purge).

  * Removed obsolete templates for MySQL & PostgreSQL.

  * Removed obsolete install-flavors templates in debian/rules.

  * Install Sqlite and Sqlite3 scripts properly.

  * Removed obsolete translations (they were causing build errors now
    that the obsolete templates are gone)

 -- John Goerzen <jgoerzen@complete.org>  Thu, 11 May 2006 06:45:44 -0500

bacula (1.38.9-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Sanitize dependencies in control -- make sure everything that
    needs to depends on bacula-common and use bacula-server and 
    bacula-client.

  * Reverse direction of /var/log/bacula/log symlink to have main
    logfile written in /var/log/bacula.

  * Install upstream's default logrotate (with Debian's path).
    Previously, there was no logrotate installed by default.
    Closes: #309675.

  * Removed duplicate user-adding code from bacula-director-common.
    bacula-common already does this.

  * Removed spurious chown/chmod of /var/run/bacula from bacula-sd
    and bacula-fd.  bacula-common already does this.

  * Moved chmod/chown of /var/lib/bacula and /var/log/bacula
    from bacula-director-common to bacula-common.  These areas may be
    used by non-director packages as well.

  * Slight simplification of debian/rules

  * Switched to dbconfig-common for PostgreSQL.  Closes: #365096.
  
  * Removed large amounts of old code for PostgreSQL support.

bacula (1.38.9-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New maintainer: John Goerzen <jgoerzen@complete.org>.
    Closes: #366625.
    Thanks to Jose Luis Tallon for initially packaging and maintaining
    Bacula in Debian.

  * Close bugs that have been fixed in my earlier NMUs.
    Closes: #322753, #335809, #343762, #326175, #309601, #305220, #329271.
    Closes: #326178, #312329, #303456, #339341, #339322, #281957, #331757.
    Closes: #358762, #357619, #337250, #337376, #346430, #314492, #303862.
    Closes: #339084.

  * Examine all diffs to upstream and revert ones that are not
    (any longer) necessary.

  * Revert diff to db.m4 -- Bacula is now aware of pg_config natively.

  * Removed commented-out patching/unpatching code in debian/rules

  * Removed obsolete patch files debian/patches/*.patches,
    debian/patches/*old.  These were only referenced by commented-out
    code in debian/rules.

  * Revert patch to dbd_find.c -- no apparent reason existed for
    the change.

  * Reverted hack to comment in update_mysql_tables_6_to_7

  * Reverted hack to configure checking on syntax

  * Renamed bacula-wxconsole to bacula-console-wx to maintain a
    sane naming scheme.  Closes: #326177.

  * Removed commented-out bacula-doc section from debian/control.

  * Build-depends on mtx.

  * Removed commented-out build-depends-indep for docs.

  * Rewrote debian/rules build system -- now uses suggested vim-like 
    build system.  It calls configure several times and builds the
    package for each DB, rather than trying to hack the configure
    system to short-circuit that.

  * Use stock make_catalog_backup/delete_catalog_backup scripts,
    and move these into the per-db bacula-director-* packages.

  * Now build Sqlite3 packages (in addition to existing Sqlite v2
    packages) and make them the default.

  * Fix sqlite build-deps.  Previous versions build-dep'd on sqlite3
    but built using sqlite2.

  * No longer rename consoles in rules.

  * Update standards-version to 3.7.0.
  
  * Clean target removes config.log

  * Move bcopy and bscan manpages into proper bacula-sd-*sql* packages

  * Added missing debconf dependencies to the bacula director packages

  * Added missing adduser dependency to bacula-director-common

  * Fixed menu files for correct location of console files

bacula (1.38.9-0.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * No longer rm -rf /var/lib/bacula in bacula-director-common postinst.
    Other Bacula packages may still be installed, and this breaks them.
  * Include bwild and bregex in bacula-director-* packages.

 -- John Goerzen <jgoerzen@complete.org>  Tue,  9 May 2006 08:45:28 -0500

bacula (1.38.9-0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release: 1.38.9, which is mostly a bugfix release.

 -- John Goerzen <jgoerzen@complete.org>  Mon,  8 May 2006 10:50:45 -0500

bacula (1.38.8-0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer upload by John Goerzen.
  * Add missing build-deps: libgnomeui-dev, libx11-dev.
  * Commented out code that attempts to patch pg_hba.conf.  This sort of
    thing should never be done without prompting the user.  It was broken
    for sid as written, and also failed to take into account the
    possibility of Unix domain sockets or having multiple versions of
    PostgreSQL on a machine.  Closes: #309601.
  * Build-Conflicts on python2.2-dev.  The configure script will use it
    by default, instead of python2.3-dev, if it's available.  This could
    lead to different Python versions being linked in on different archs.
  * Numerous fixes to clean target to make sure all sorts of otherwise-missed
    generated files get removed.
  * Removed spurious chown of /var/lib/bacula in 
    bacula-director-common.preinst.  Having it there could lead to 
    failure to install that package since that directory may not already
    exist.  postinst for that package was already doing the same chown
    anyway.
  * Removed erreneous chown attempt of /var/log/bacula/log in
    bacula-director-common.postinst.  This file is not installed
    by this package.  Closes: #303862.
  * Fixed distribution of bscan and bcopy such that they appear in their
    bacula-sd-* properly, and not in bacula-director or bacula-sd.
  * debian/rules contains bashisms and will not build if bash is not
    the default shell.  Explicitly set SHELL in debian/rules.

  * The below changes were made available by Jose Luis Tallon on SourceForge.

  * New upstream version (Closes: #339322)

  * New upstream version. Some fixes and enhancements (Closes: #297477)

  * bacula-director-pgsql: postinst fixed (Closes: #289838, #272191)

    - use the configured root password
    - support remote pgsql hosts
    - patch the grant script to re-enable key indexes needed

 -- Jose Luis Tallon <jltallon@adv-solutions.net>  Fri, 3 Dec 2004 18:22:05 +0100

bacula (1.36.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version (Closes: #278605)
    - hopefully solves problems where bacula-fd segfaulted
    - database format changed to v8. Add upgrading v6 -> v7 -> v8 
      capabilities to postinst scripts. (Closes: #271892)
    - updatedb scripts patched, to avoid problem with PostgreSQL update.

  * bacula-director-common: added "reload" action (send SIGHUP)

bacula (1.34.6-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * PgSQL "flavor":
    - another little build improvement (Closes: #274997)
    - typo in 'config', reported by PMHahn (Closes: #275284)

 -- Jose Luis Tallon <jltallon@adv-solutions.net>  Sat, 9 Oct 2004 16:04:05 +0200

bacula (1.34.6-2) unstable; urgency=high

  * Urgency high because the PostgreSQL "flavor" is not properly built.
    It is linked against the "internal" database, which is not functional.
    - The flag to enable PostgreSQL is called "HAVE_POSTGRESQL" instead of
      HAVE_PGSQL -- Reported by E Zanardi <ezanard@debian.org>
    - Newer libpq needs -lssl -lcrypto...

  * bacula-director-mysql: fixed bogus update procedure 
    - succeed when catalog is already up-to-date (Closes: #271998)
    - work when admin user has a non-blank password.

  * bacula-director-pgsql: fixed problem, where --regardless of specified
    dbadmin-- root was used to connect to PgSQL (Closes: #272181)

  * bacula-sd: daemon leaves FD 0,1,2 open; Close them.
    Backported change to lib/daemon.c from 1.35.3 (Closes: #272083)

  * bacula-director-common: 
    - link /usr/lib/bacula/smtp to bsmtp to preserve older configurations 
      (Closes: #272880)
    - Integrated patch from Daniel Hermann, to ensure proper 'director'
    termination in init.d script (Closes: #271579)

  * Integrated some more of PMHahn build enhancements. Thanks!

  * Properly building the static bscan "flavors" brings in 
    many build dependencies..ggrrrr
    ( libpq depends on libkrb5, libk5crypto, libcom_err, libcrypt,... )

  * Corrected some more typos
    - Missing cleanup after building "flavored" binaries
    - Missing 'btraceback' component

  * Package sponsored by Roberto Lumbreras <rover@debian.org>

bacula (1.34.6-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New upstream version
  * Applied patch to avoid deadlocks in bacula-dir (urgency -> high)

  * Several cleanups from both Philipp M Hahn & Filip Van Raemdonck. I can't
    sufficiently express my gratitude here. Thanks!!
    - fixed upgrade support
    - build improvements
    - several minor fixups/reorganization. I hope i got it right this time..

  * Now bscan is a set of 3 statically-linked binaries, so that bacula-sd
    does not pull all three client libs. This had been pending for a long time...

  * Some more minor improvements
    - Logfiles are already in /var/log/bacula/ (Closes: #254245)
    - Fixed perms on /var/log/bacula/log (Closes: #252410)

  * Bacula's GNOME console was already linked against v2 libs 
    since 1.34.5-1 (Closes: #264975)

  * MySQL flavor's postinst issues
    - Wrong ordering of db_get / assignment (Closes: #270329)
    - Split line changes meaning, other cleanups (Closes: #270197)

  * Updated debconf translations
    - FR (Closes: #269958)
    - JA, by Hideki Yamane <henrich@samba.gr.jp> (Closes: #270765)

  * Debconf-related fixes:
    - Updated versioned dependency w/Debconf: v1.4.30 seems to work.
    - Reset password's "seen" flag, so that it gets asked again
    - Moved root password question back to 'config' grr...

  * Several adjustments to descriptions; minor additions to Suggests:
    Matthew Hawkins has provided invaluable feedback here. Thanks!!!

  * The "fix all those typos" release.
    - Shin-young Yune: -director-pgsql.postinst
    - typos in -director-{my,pg}sql 's postinst scripts
    - typos in dh_link commands to get manpages installed

  * Misc fixes
    - /var/lib/bacula absent from -director-common (Closes: #270196)
    - /usr/share/bacula-common/defconfig dir was empty!
    - grant_pgsql_privileges missing from -director-common
    - adjusted dependencies so that meta-packages can be upgraded

bacula (1.34.5-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * Urgency high, because:
    - TLS libraries from libc6-i686 no longer break bacula. (Closes: #250351)

  * New upstream version (Closes: #242725, #242735)
    - Supports PostgreSQL for the catalog (Closes: #252244)
    - Supports backup to disk.
    - Supports backing up ACLs (enabled in this package)
    - Several minor bugfixes since 1.34.2

  * Completely redone, much more efficient, build system. Contributed by
    Turbo Fredriksson <turbo@debian.org> and adapted by me: now only the
    "flavor-dependent"(cats,dird,tools) are rebuilt, instead of the full
    package. The scripts are also generated from 'rules' instead.

  * Several upstream enhancements/changes;
    + Database schema changes: `postinst' will try to upgrade MySQL & SQLite
    + Added PostgreSQL support for the catalog
    + Added support for disk-based backups, etc (see Documentation)

  * Security related changes
    - More secure password handling in configure/postinst (prompt during postinst,
    delete password inmediately) -- breaks unattended installs unless one
    uses debconf seeding, sorry; Warnings with lintian/linda, grrr...
    - Added TCP wrappers(libwrap) support, after agreement with
    Steve Smith (Closes: #245626)
    - Ensured proper ownership and permissions for /var/lib/bacula, in order
    for the PostgreSQL port to run securely.

  * Upgrade to compiling/linking the console against Gnome2;

        - bacula (1.32f-3-1)	28 Jan 2004

         * Fixed a typo in bacula-director-mysql, which made postinst stomp on
           existing configuration file. Noticed by Dick Middleton.
           Robustness features in bacula-director-mysql.postinst.

         * Slightly better manpages.

         * Readied for first upload to Debian's archive.

        - bacula (1.32b-5)	24 Dec 2003

          * Completely revamped the bacula-director-mysql postinst, based
            upon suggestions/debugging by Frank Lenaerts.

            Alvaro Hernandez Tortosa <aht@ahtech.net>

          * Added "chmod 755" for scripts in the patches subdir to rules,

        - bacula (1.32b-4)	23 Nov 2003

          * Strengthened permissions on /etc/bacula and FD/SD/Director config
            files, to avoid giving away passwords to local users and thus
            avoid attacks.  Problem reported/solution suggested by Frank
            Lenaerts.

          * Verified dependencies, loosened a bit so that backporting is easier.
            Suggested by Frank Lenaerts <lenaerts.frank@pandora.be>

        - bacula (1.32b-3)	10 Nov 2003
