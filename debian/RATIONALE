RATIONALE for packaging decisions in "Bacula"

* utility programs (bsmtp, dbcheck) under /usr/lib/bacula, because they are
part of the suite, as opposed to bls/bscan/bextract/btape which are under
/usr/sbin, for the administrator's convenience

* 'btraceback' is under /usr/lib/bacula. There is a symlink in /usr/sbin for
compatibility. The modified version looks for btraceback.gdb in /usr/lib/bacula
instead.

* 'console' moved to /usr/sbin/bacula-console. Add convenience script
/usr/bin/console which calls bacula-console with the '-c switch', so that it
looks for its config file directly in /etc/bacula

* 'gnome-console' is now /usr/bin/bacula-gnome-console, to avoid namespace
pollution. I won't add a wrapper script, since this is expected to be run
from GUI; The required '-c /etc/bacula/gnome-console.conf' can be added in
the launcher instead (and so it is done in the .menu app link)


---- 

* Won't split bacula-sd into -mysql and -sqlite, even if might be needed
 (btape, bscan, links against -lsql ):
 They must connect to the director for this purpose.. that's why Bacula was
 designed as a distributed system ( link issue noticed & notified by Nic Bellamy
 <nic@bellamy.co.nz>

 --> Include bscan.sqlite, bscan.mysql, bscan.pgsql in bacula-sd, under
  /usr/lib so that data recovery can be attempted with the supplied package
  in the event that the catalog gets damaged; As politely asked by 
  Christof Lehmann
