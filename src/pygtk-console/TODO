TO-DO Feature Notes for Bacula PyGTK Console
============================================

1) Always focus in the command line when in the Console tab. [DONE]
2) Indicate in the status line when it is waiting on a command. [DONE]
3) Implement some kind of tray monitor icon (see additional notes)
4) Implement the most frequent restore use cases (see additional notes).
5) Implement a good messages browser (see additional notes). [DONE:
Instead of a message browser I did a very simple message log viewer]

===========================================================================
ADDITIONAL NOTES:

Below I'll be adding more details to some of the points listed above.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Restore Use Cases
-----------------

a. Restore the most current view of the system (option 5 on the
menu). Note, this could involve a lot of different jobs (full,
differential, and any number of incrementals).

b. Same as above, but at some given time in the past (presumably
before some files got messed up).

c. Restore files from a specified Job.

d. Give me a list of where and when file X was backed up and allow me
to choose.  This is not a direct option, but requires several steps.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Messages Browser
----------------

A messages browser similar to an e-mail browser can be very useful for
various reasons:

a. The admin(s) don't need to check out its email to receive notices.

b. The GUI can take advantage of this data to enhance interactivity
(ie: when running some job, the director ask the admin to label the
Volume, this is received from a message that can be checked from the
GUI and give the appropriate warning.

Other features: the messages may be interesting to be saved on disk to
have some sort of log between program executions.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tray monitor icon
-----------------

Some ideas that I've collected from the mailing list:

a. Be configurable: [] show errors | [] show messages
b. Show the backup speed
c. Error message: backup failures
d. Error message: waiting for mount / label
e. Running jobs number
