This is the Bacula PyGTK Console project, its objective is to write a
full featured administration console to allow administrators do simple
and not-so-simple taks on Bacula in an easy manner.

The GUI design as well as the program features are under construction
right now, they all may change in the future...or not.

Compiling requirements:
----------------------
* Bacula source code
* Python devel files
* SWIG wrapper generator

Running requirements:
--------------------
* Python language
* Python's GTK+ bindings
* Python GTK MVC module (http://pygtkmvc.sf.net)
*  which can be downloaded from:
*  http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=123428
* A running and configured Bacula system
