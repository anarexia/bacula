Well fortunately there are not too many bugs, but thanks to Dan Langille, we
have a 
\elink{bugs database}{http://bugs.bacula.org} where bugs are reported.
Generally, when a bug is fixed, a patch for the currently release version will
be attached to the bug report.

The directory {\bf patches} in the current CVS always contains a list of 
the patches that have been created for the previously released version
of Bacula. In addition, the file {\bf patches-version-number} in the 
{\bf patches} directory contains a summary of each of the patches.

A ``raw'' list of the current task list and known issues can be found in {\bf
kernstodo} in the main Bacula source directory.
