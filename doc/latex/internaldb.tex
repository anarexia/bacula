Previously it was intended to be used primarily by Bacula developers for
testing; although SQLite is also a good choice for this. We do not recommend
its use in general. 

This database is simplistic in that it consists entirely of Bacula's internal
structures appended sequentially to a file. Consequently, it is in most cases
inappropriate for sites with many clients or systems with large numbers of
files, or long-term production environments. 

Below, you will find a table comparing the features available with SQLite and
MySQL and with the internal Bacula database. At the current time, you cannot
dynamically switch from one to the other, but must rebuild the Bacula source
code. If you wish to experiment with both, it is possible to build both
versions of Bacula and install them into separate directories.

In addition, since there is no SQL available, the Console commands: {\bf
sqlquery}, {\bf query}, {\bf retention}, and any other command that directly
uses SQL are not available with the Internal database.
