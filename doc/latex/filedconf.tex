The Client (or File Daemon) Configuration is one of the simpler ones to
specify. Generally, other than changing the Client name so that error messages
are easily identified, you will not need to modify the default Client
configuration file. 

For a general discussion of configuration file and resources including the
data types recognized by {\bf Bacula}, please see the 
\ilink{Configuration}{_ChapterStart16} chapter of this manual. The
following Client Resource definitions must be defined: 

\begin{itemize}
\item 
   \ilink{Client}{ClientResource} -- to define what Clients are  to
   be backed up.  
\item 
   \ilink{Director}{DirectorResource} -- to  define the Director's
   name and its access password.  
\item 
   \ilink{Messages}{_ChapterStart15} -- to define where error  and
   information messages are to be sent. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{The Client Resource}
\label{ClientResource}
\index[general]{Resource!Client }
\index[general]{Client Resource }
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Client Resource}

The Client Resource (or FileDaemon) resource defines the name of the Client
(as used by the Director) as well as the port on which the Client listens for
Director connections. 

\begin{description}

\item [Client (or FileDaemon)]
   \index[fd]{Client (or FileDaemon) }
   Start of the Client records.  There must be one and only one Client resource
in the  configuration file, since it defines the properties of the  current
client program. 

\item [Name = \lt{}name\gt{}]
   \index[fd]{Name  }
   The client name that must be used  by the Director when connecting. Generally,
it is a good idea  to use a name related to the machine so that error messages
can be easily identified if you have multiple Clients.  This record is
required.  

\item [Working Directory = \lt{}Directory\gt{}]
   \index[fd]{Working Directory  }
   This directive  is mandatory and specifies a directory in which the File
daemon  may put its status files. This directory should be used only  by {\bf
Bacula}, but may be shared by other Bacula daemons. This  record is required  

\item [Pid Directory = \lt{}Directory\gt{}]
   \index[dir]{Pid Directory  }
   This directive  is mandatory and specifies a directory in which the Director 
may put its process Id file files. The process Id file is used to  shutdown
Bacula and to prevent multiple copies of  Bacula from running simultaneously. 
This record is required. Standard shell expansion of the {\bf Directory}  is
done when the configuration file is read so that values such  as {\bf \$HOME}
will be properly expanded.  

Typically on Linux systems, you will set this to:  {\bf /var/run}. If you are
not installing Bacula in the  system directories, you can use the {\bf Working
Directory} as  defined above. 

\item [Heartbeat Interval = \lt{}time-interval\gt{}]
   \index[dir]{Heartbeat Interval  }
   This record defines an interval of time.  For each heartbeat that the
   File daemon receives from the Storage daemon, it will forward it to the
   Director.  In addition, if no heartbeat has been received from the
   Storage daemon and thus forwarded the File daemon will send a heartbeat
   signal to the Director and to the Storage daemon to keep the channels
   active.  The default interval is zero which disables the heartbeat.
   This feature is particularly useful if you have a router such as 3Com
   that does not follow Internet standards and times out an inactive
   connection after a short duration.

\item [Maximum Concurrent Jobs = \lt{}number\gt{}]
   \index[dir]{Maximum Concurrent Jobs  }
   where \lt{}number\gt{} is the maximum number of Jobs that should run
   concurrently.  The default is set to 2, but you may set it to a larger
   number.  Each contact from the Director (e.g.  status request, job start
   request) is considered as a Job, so if you want to be able to do a {\bf
   status} request in the console at the same time as a Job is running, you
   will need to set this value greater than 1.

\item [FDAddresses = \lt{}IP-address-specification\gt{}]
   \index[console]{FDAddresses  }
   Specify the ports and addresses on which the Director daemon will listen
   for Bacula Console connections.  Probably the simplest way to explain is
   to show an example:

\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
 FDAddresses  = { ip = {
        addr = 1.2.3.4; port = 1205; }
    ipv4 = {
        addr = 1.2.3.4; port = http; }
    ipv6 = {
        addr = 1.2.3.4;
        port = 1205;
    }
    ip = {
        addr = 1.2.3.4
        port = 1205
    }
    ip = {
        addr = 1.2.3.4
    }
    ip = {
        addr = 201:220:222::2
    }
    ip = {
        addr = bluedot.thun.net
    }
 }
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

where ip, ip4, ip6, addr, and port are all keywords. Note, that  the address
can be specified as either a dotted quadruple, or  IPv6 colon notation, or as
a symbolic name (only in the ip specification).  Also, port can be specified
as a number or as the mnemonic value from  the /etc/services file.  If a port
is not specified, the default will be used. If an ip  section is specified,
the resolution can be made either by IPv4 or  IPv6. If ip4 is specified, then
only IPv4 resolutions will be permitted,  and likewise with ip6.  

\item [FDPort = \lt{}port-number\gt{}]
   \index[console]{FDPort  }
   This specifies the port number  on which the Client listens for Director
connections. It must agree  with the FDPort specified in the Client resource
of the Director's  configuration file. The default is 9102. 

\item [FDAddress = \lt{}IP-Address\gt{}]
   \index[console]{FDAddress  }
   This record is optional,  and if it is specified, it will cause the File
daemon server (for  Director connections) to bind to the specified {\bf
IP-Address},  which is either a domain name or an IP address specified as a 
dotted quadruple. If this record is not specified, the File daemon  will bind
to any available address (the default). 

\item [SDConnectTimeout = \lt{}time-interval\gt{}]
   \index[console]{SDConnectTimeout  }
   This  record defines an interval of time that  the File daemon will try to
connect to the  Storage daemon. The default is 30 minutes. If no connection 
is made in the specified time interval, the File daemon  cancels the Job. 

\item [Maximum Network Buffer Size = \lt{}bytes\gt{}]  
   \index[console]{Maximum Network Buffer Size  }
   where \lt{}bytes\gt{} specifies the initial network buffer  size to use with
the File daemon. This size will be adjusted down  if it is too large until it
is accepted by the OS. Please use  care in setting this value since if it is
too large, it will  be trimmed by 512 bytes until the OS is happy, which may
require  a large number of system calls. The default value is 32,768 bytes. 
\end{description}

The following is an example of a valid Client resource definition: 

\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
Client {                              # this is me
  Name = rufus-fd
  WorkingDirectory = $HOME/bacula/bin/working
  Pid Directory = $HOME/bacula/bin/working
}
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

\subsection*{The Director Resource}
\label{DirectorResource}
\index[general]{Director Resource }
\index[general]{Resource!Director }
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Director Resource}

The Director resource defines the name and password of the Directors that are
permitted to contact this Client. 

\begin{description}

\item [Director]
   \index[fd]{Director }
   Start of the Director records. There may be any  number of Director resources
in the Client configuration file. Each  one specifies a Director that is
allowed to connect to this  Client. 

\item [Name = \lt{}name\gt{}]
   \index[fd]{Name  }
   The name of the Director  that may contact this Client. This name must be the 
same as the name specified on the Director resource  in the Director's
configuration file. This record is required. 

\item [Password = \lt{}password\gt{}]
   \index[fd]{Password  }
   Specifies the password that must be  supplied for a Director to be authorized.
This password  must be the same as the password specified in the  Client
resource in the Director's configuration file.  This record is required. 

\item [Monitor = \lt{}yes|no\gt{}]
   \index[fd]{Monitor  }
   If Monitor is set to {\bf no} (default),  this director will have full access
to this Client. If Monitor is set to  {\bf yes}, this director will only be
able to fetch the current status  of this Client.

Please note that if this director is being used by a Monitor, we highly 
recommend to set this directive to {\bf yes} to avoid serious security 
problems. 
\end{description}

Thus multiple Directors may be authorized to use this Client's services. Each
Director will have a different name, and normally a different password as
well. 

The following is an example of a valid Director resource definition: 

\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
#
# List Directors who are permitted to contact the File daemon
#
Director {
  Name = HeadMan
  Password = very_good                # password HeadMan must supply
}
Director {
  Name = Worker
  Password = not_as_good
  Monitor = Yes
}
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

\subsection*{The Message Resource}
\label{MessagesResource}
\index[general]{Message Resource }
\index[general]{Resource!Message }
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Message Resource}

Please see the 
\ilink{Messages Resource}{_ChapterStart15} Chapter of this
manual for the details of the Messages Resource. 

There must be at least one Message resource in the Client configuration file. 

\subsection*{Example Client Configuration File}
\label{SampleClientConfiguration}
\index[general]{Example Client Configuration File }
\index[general]{File!Example Client Configuration }
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Example Client Configuration File}

An example File Daemon configuration file might be the following: 

\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
#
# Default  Bacula File Daemon Configuration file
#
#  For Bacula release 1.35.2 (16 August 2004) -- gentoo 1.4.16
#
# There is not much to change here except perhaps to
#   set the Director's name and File daemon's name
#   to something more appropriate for your site.
#
#
# List Directors who are permitted to contact this File daemon
#
Director {
  Name = rufus-dir
  Password = "/LqPRkX++saVyQE7w7mmiFg/qxYc1kufww6FEyY/47jU"
}
#
# Restricted Director, used by tray-monitor to get the
#   status of the file daemon
#
Director {
  Name = rufus-mon
  Password = "FYpq4yyI1y562EMS35bA0J0QC0M2L3t5cZObxT3XQxgxppTn"
  Monitor = yes
}
#
# "Global" File daemon configuration specifications
#
FileDaemon {                          # this is me
  Name = rufus-fd
  WorkingDirectory = $HOME/bacula/bin/working
  Pid Directory = $HOME/bacula/bin/working
}
# Send all messages except skipped files back to Director
Messages {
  Name = Standard
  director = rufus-dir = all, !skipped
}
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
