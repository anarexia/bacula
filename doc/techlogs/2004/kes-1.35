                        Kern Sibbald

General:

Changes to 1.35.9:
20Oct04
- Fix altering PostgreSQL table to be compatible with version 7.3.
19Oct04
- Modify install of make_catalog_backup and delete_catalog_backup so
  that it will not overwrite any existing file.
- Additional documentation.
- Modified detection of largefiles to always set all flags regardless
  of the machine.
- Modify autostart scripts to start Bacula late in the process and
  terminate it early.
- Drop CDImages table in drop database tables scripts.
- Alter casting of (void *) in gnome2-console/restore.c to pass
  by a (long int) so that it works with 64 bit machines.
- Add more debug to heartbeat.c in FD for problem of dropped connections.
18Oct04
- Adjust priorities for starting/stopping daemons to be
  started late and stopped early as suggested by Marc Williams.
18Oct04
- Adjust priorities for starting/stopping daemons to be
  started late and stopped early as suggested by Marc Williams.
18Oct04
- Fix crash on exit with -t option in FD on 2.6 kernels -- 
  uninitialized thread id variable.
- Add additional SD and FD debug info to detect network hang.
- Fix bnet_strerror() routine not to return stack pointer.
- Put latest update routines in updatedb.
16Oct04
- Fix error during restore error reported by Christopher Hull when
  no tape in the drive (open fails).
- Add more precise error reporting to FD when a network error
  occurs.
15Oct04
- Fix empty files reported by Marin (zero file_size in dev.c).
- Update all the db update scripts to include the new multiple
  key index on File proposed by Martin, and to fix up a few
  minor things with PostgreSQL.
- Apply Christopher Hull's patch for getting the catalog correct
  during a restore.
- Created a patch for 1.34.6 (and code in 1.35) to detect passing
  the A option to the FD, which means enable ACL processing.
  Submitted by Ben Vitale.
13Oct04
- Fix syntax error in make_mysql_tables.in pointed out by Scott.
12Oct04
- Add a kludge to detect bad date/times, which cause a seg fault in
  Microsoft's version of localtime_r().  So, now we know that Microsoft
  programmers do not check return codes!
- Minor update to web site (new projects page).
- Remove bigint for filenameid from postgresql table -- as demonstrated
  by Martin, it has negative performance repercussions.
- Rework getuser() and getgroup() to avoid any possible race condition 
  by returning the value in a buffer rather than from the cached table.
- Add a bit more debug code to the FD status output.

Changes to 1.35.8:
09Oct04
- Documentation.
- Integrate Peter Ericksson's dbx traceback scripts into Bacula
08Oct04
- Fix segfault in lsmark command in restore tree.
- Fix segfault in editing numbers in count command of restore tree.
- Add missing #define for IPV6 found by Martin in address_conf.c
- Use strcasecmp() instead of strcmp() in address_conf.c
07Oct04
- Fix bug where SD crashes on label if drive is not open
  (i.e. Always Open = no).
- Added "Rerun Failed Levels = yes/no"
- Made calling offline_or_rewind() non-fatal if the
  device is not open.
- Added Martin's suggestion to have multiple level index on
  the file table.
- Update doc
- Fix misspelled #define in mysql.c for threading pointed out
  by a user. 
- Fix incorrect prototype.
- Attempt to fix Solaris crash in SD during status command. 
04Oct04
- Fix backspace to first character in conio.c
- Add umount command for Phil. :-)
- Fix update volume volfrompool.
- Modify restore to print an error message if the size of a
  restored file does not correspond to the saved stat packet.
- Fix count of files to be restored *not* to include 
  top level created directories.

Changes to 1.35.7:
03Oct04
- Apply Martin's patch that puts back the run pool override
  code -- dumb me for removing it.

Changes to 1.35.6:
02Oct04
- Fix typo in SD sscanf() of relabel command.
- Create patches/README and the patch summary file.
- Use different share mode when opening files on WinMe/98/95 since
  SHARE_DELETE is not implemented on those systems.
- In new syntax Includes, pass *all* files through the acceptance
  filter so that no error messages will be printed for files that
  cannot be opened if they are excluded.
01Oct04
- Fix bug 126 (Martin) -- prevent failed console label request from 
  going into fixup code and thus trying to update the catalog.
- Always fold case in fnmatch() on Win32 systems
30Sep04
- Create patches directory
- Apply Martin's patch for fixing console modifications to Verify Jobs.
- Fix Win32 so that it can backup files that are opened by programs
  such as Word (certain open system files cannot be backed up).

Changes to 1.35.5:
29Sep04
- Fix Storage overrides in Run directive
- Fix seg fault in AlertCommand
- Fix btape "test" and "fill" commands to work with new SD
  data structures.  There are still problems ...
26Sep04
- Correct buffer length passed to inet_ntop() in address_conf.c
- Increase the debug level of a lot of messages to reduce the
  debugging "noise".
- Modify how ST_APPEND is handled so that nothing is written
  to the Volume if it is not set. It is now set only when
  the Volume label is verified, and released when the volume
  is released. This required a number of minor but rather
  critical and fundamental changes.
- Improve quickly terminating a job in the SD when it errs.
  More status checking and a few additional checks on
  job_canceled() and check more error return statuses.
- Added a number of debug statements (to be removed later) that
  check the VolCatName for a name.
- Create a single subroutine that handles terminating writing
  on a Volume at the end of the volume (or after an error).
- Continued to add use of the berrno classs for strerror().
25Sep04
- Apply conio patches supplied by Peter Eriksson for configure.in
  conio.h and conio.c to make it work better on Solaris.
- Make run_grub print manual procedure for installing grub
- Add extra setsockopt keepalive.
- Add code to set as many options as possible in the system
  tape driver for different OSes.
24Sep04
- Apply Peter Eriksson's patch to configure.in fixes finding
  correct libs on Solaris to link conio -- bug 121
- Add expected number of files to Verify VolumeToCatalog, and
  if it does not equal the examined files, fail the job.
  Fixes bug -- 114
- Modify the depend section of each Makefile.in to reference $(CXX)
  instead of $(CC) -- bug 118
- Remove the word "restore" from the Volumes needed message in
  dird/bsr.c since the message is used for Restore and Verify.
- Fix initialization and copying of the storage resource when
  starting jobs (and in jobq.c when restarting). In some cases
  jcr->store was not set causing a segfault -- bug 116
23Sep04
- More doc.
- Pass EndFile and EndBlock to SD.  
22Sep04
- Fixed bscan to close() drive between tapes.
- Turn on transactions for SQLite and PostgreSQL if
  multiple connections are turned on.
- Removed stripping of filename in ua_tree insertion routine.
- Fix split_path_and_filename() routines to return zero length
  path and files.
- Modify update_tables scripts to convert a single blank filename
  into an empty filename.
- Incremented the release number because this version requires
  an update to the database.
  Use:
    cd src/cats
    ./update_bacula_tables  
  to update an existing database.
- Implemented EndFile and EndBlock in the Media record. This will
  allow Bacula to know exactly when to stop reading a tape if the
  stupid tape driver does not give a logical end of tape indication 
  and Bacula writes to the end of the tape getting an I/O error.
- Added new routines to update the database, and there are
  new database creation routines to add the two new Media columns.
- The Media record is updated each time a JobMedia record is created.
  This keeps the Media record up to date.
- Undid the code to use automatic type converions to char * in
  POOL_MEM. This is due to the ugly consequences of essentially
  destroying the class type nature of the class.
- Removed all the old mp_char() #define code.

Changes to 1.35.4:
22Sep04
- Add additional doc.
- Implement automatic POOL_MEM type conversion to char *. Thanks
  to Martin Simmons for the suggestion.
- Remove some unneeded function overloading -- need removed by
  automatic type conversion.
21Sep04
- Correct segfault in message.c with debug=200 (new code).
- Fix bug 109 verify with no options prints garbage.
- Add ioctl(MTIOCGET) call to clrerror_dev() in dev.c. As reported
  by Frank Kardel, this should clear error conditions on NetBSD.
20Sep04
- Modify the rescue script to create mount_drives with
  the order specified by Philip Nash (mkdir, mount).
- Tweak install chapter of French manual to add new paragraph
  from English.
- Tweak restore tree message to be a bit clearer.
- Modify watchdog to wakeup after 60 seconds, or wakeup if
  there is work to do.
- Modify watchdog stop routine to "ping" watchdog so that it
  stops immediately rather than after sleep time.
- Fix btape to use new dcr blocks rather than its own.
- Fix butil.c to correctly handle Volume names for the
  utility routines (broke when updating to dcrs).
11-19Sep04 (vacation)
- Implement multiple Storage specifications in the Job resource
  (AND) each containing multiple specifications (OR). Not yet functional.
  Note, this needs more work as most things now use
  job->storage[0]->first() rather than looping through devices.
- Implement "Multiple connections = yes/no" in Catalog record for
  allowing multiple simultaneous connections to the database.
- Add new mac.c (Migrate, Archive, Copy) to dird -- not yet implemented.
- Implement a new POOL_MEM class that automatically allocates
  and deallocates a pool buffer.
- Overload a number of utility routines to permit using both
  POOLMEM and POOL_MEM.
- Start converting to using POOL_MEM.
- There were a number of Bacula console ACL checks missing in
  ua_run.c. It allowed users to run jobs they really should not.
- Correct a number of dates on the Copyright.
- Overload pm_strcpy() and pm_strcat() to handle new POOL_MEM
  class.
- Overload bash/unbash_spaces to handle new POOL_MEM class.
- Make a *MASSIVE* pass through the Storage daemon eliminating
  all use of jcr->VolumeName and jcr->VolCatInfo in favor of
  dcr->...  
- Eliminate all all redundant arguments from calling sequences
  in SD. This poses a number of problems due to the old way blocks
  and records were allocated and released all the time. They are
  now contained in the dcr. The problem is that old habits die hard
  and there are still places where everything is not right.
- Implement "Block positioning = yes/no" in Device resource in SD.

Changes to 1.35.3
09Sep04
- Add "Multiple Connections = yes/no" in catalog record. Only
  the variable is implemented, no code yet.
- Close *all* FD unless debug on. 
08Sep04
- Add first cut of UTF-8 support to conio. It "seems" to be working
  pretty well. Moving by words will definitely not work though.
- Improve detection and setting of gateway in the 
  network_start script.
07Sep04
- Modify scan code so that in most places scanning will
  continue across the end of a line.
05Sep04
- Begin major phase of 1.35 documentation.
- All outstanding bugs are fixed.
- Implement changes and improvements to rescue scripts as
  proposed by Gaurav.
05Sep04
- Add correction to Phil's previous patch.
- Send all queued messages in SD and FD prior to closing down    
  the job.
- Send queued messages in Jobs before terminating the job 
  so that the messages print before the job report.
- Add a destructor so that the Console ACLs are properly
  freed.
04Sep04
- Implement isolinux boot disk.
- Integrate Phil Stracchino's code (thanks for Matt's help).
  It permits lists and ranges of jobids on the delete as in:
  delete job jobid=1,3,5,11-16
03Sep04
- Apply Mike Acar's suggestion when looking for the next volume
  to check purged volumes for recycling before doing a purge.
- Make some improvements to CDROM disk.
- Take another crack at ignoring drive open() errors during
  polling.
02Sep04
- Add eliminate orphaned job records; eliminate admin records,
  and eliminate restore records to dbcheck.
- replace sprintf by bsnprintf() in dbcheck.
- Added scan target to makefile in rescue cd to print scsi
  devices.
- Added argument to berrno::strerror() to pass errno.
- Cleaned up a few more old strerror() calls and eliminated a
  few of the now unnecessary set_errno() calls.
- Fixed a bug in the polling code that prevented more than 100
  label reads (insanity check disabled if polling).
- Ignore bad return from open_device() if polling.
- Short circuit code if fatal error return from read_label() in
  mount.c
01Sep04
- Add index file to JobId field of File records for PostgreSQL.
- Correct several bugs in the job queue scheduler concerning   
  rescheduled jobs: 1. The SD status was not cleared causing a
  wrong status to be displayed by Dir after rescheduling. 2. All
  rescheduled jobs became zombies because the jcr use_count was
  not decremented properly.
- Make the Catalog resource required in Client records.
- Order the listing of where a file is (item 2 on the restore
  menu) by StartTime.
- Clarify when a filename only and a full path + filename must
  be entered in items 2 and 8 of the restore menu.
- Fix logic error in resolution of names on IPv4 systems.

Changes to 1.35.2 released 01Sep04:
30Aug04
- Inhibit printing of FileSet for a restore as it is misleading.
- Cleaned up a number of minor scripting problems with the CDROM
  creation.
- Fixed a race condition causing a Director crash on termination,
  if a large number of SIGHUPs were sent during a multiple concurrent
  set of backups.
28Aug04
- Completed integration of Rescue CD scripts with Bacula source.
28Aug04
- Added Ignore FileSet Changes = yes
- Added more error checking to the spooling code.
24Aug04
- Applied a patch from Peter Eriksson that removes a dynamic stack
  allocation (replaced by alloca) and fixes some const problems.
- Fixed a free() of a static variable in the new IP code bnet.c
- Got the new Bacula Rescue CDROM booting.
- Replaced a dynamic template by a simple store when using the
  native C compiler.
- Reworked some of the block.c error handling.
- Changed a Dmsgx(000, to Dmsgx(100 in dev.c that was dumping
  debug output on a user.
- Integrated patch from 1.34.6 block.c to 1.35
17Aug04
- Fix conio.c problem on Solaris.
- Add debug code to lock_jcr_chain().
- Lock jcr chain around less code.
- Implement call by reference for Mmsg() and pm_strxxx() to
  simplify calls.
- New IP address specification is used as follows:
    [sdaddresses|diraddresses|fdaddresses] = { [[ip|ipv4|ipv6] = { 
           [[addr|port] = [^ ]+[\n;]+] }] }

  so it could look for example like this:
     SDaddresses  = { ip = {
            addr = 1.2.3.4; port = 1205; }
        ipv4 = {
            addr = 1.2.3.4; port = http; }
        ipv6 = {
            addr = 1.2.3.4;
            port = 1205;
        }
        ip = {
            addr = 1.2.3.4
            port = 1205
        }
        ip = {
            addr = 1.2.3.4
        }
        ip = {
            addr = 2001:220:222::2
        }
        ip = {
            addr = bluedot.thun.net
        }
     }
  as a consequence, you can now specify multiple IP addresses and
  ports to be used. In the case of a server, it will listen on
  all those that you specify. In the case of connecting to the server,
  Bacula will attempt connecting to one at a time until it succeeds.
  And, in a few other special cases, Bacula will use only the first
  address specified.

  The default port numbers are still the same and the services and hosts 
  are also resolved by name. So now  you could use the real names for the 
  port numbers.

  this will fix the problem of noticing files have been moved
  into the save path after a Full save.
- Fix bug in "status dir" where not all entries are listed.

Release 1.35.0 08 July 2004:
08Jul04
- Apply Christopher Hull's const patch for PostgreSQL
- Add code to block.c to detect if block header is destroyed.
- Add debug code for memset checking for zeroing 1900-3000 bytes
  which is what happened to the block headers.
- If block header is destroyed, read the next block. Probably
  should return with new status similar to the SHORT block 
  return.
- Add more debug info to bls for bad blocks.
- More implementation of DCRs.
07Jul04
- Eliminate argument passing in SD by using dcr.
- More int->bool conversions.
- Add file:block to a number of read/write error messages.
04Jul04
- More int -> bool conversions.
- Modify the SD piece by piece to use DCRs everywhere.
- Cleanup some printout for query command. 
- Fix typo in cats/mysql.c
- Work on cleaning up tape driver a bit (use bools, better calling
  sequences).
- Attempt to fix multi-Volume disk backup. Needs to be tested.
01Jul04
- Add Regular expressions to FileSet options.
- Correct configure.in to use ${MAKE} for doing the dependencies.
- Make MySQL and PostgreSQL try for 30 seconds to connect before
  giving up.  
- Correct Gnome 1.4 Makefile to build without cats library.
- Correct a crash reported (with patch) by Jonathan Soong 
  when attempting to backup an ACL on a symlinked file.
27Jun04
- Fixed an off by one bug in the new resources pointer code.      
  res_head array was one too small.
- Added Errors to last_job list. This allows detecting jobs
  that terminated in a warning.
- Implement setting the Win32 icon to yellow instead of red
  when the job terminated OK but with warnings.
- Fix the Win32 makefile and VC project file. The links were
  not including the Win32 dlls.      
- Delete some old Win32 code that was turned off.
- Eliminate a few more Win32 compiler warnings.
- Reduce the output produced by NIS (Win32 install builder).
- Simplify some of the #ifdefing in compat.h
26Jun04
- Rewrite spooling error handling when I/O error occurs. It is
  a bit tricky, requiring to truncate the file so that a despooling
  will work correctly. Needs to be tested.
- Make better subroutines for setting up for a new job.
- Start putting all DB ids on #defines (going to 64 bits).
- Fix gnome-console Makefile.in to work again.
- All "level=Incremental/Decremental" to the estimate command. This
  required some re-arrangement of subroutines at a fairly low level.
25Jun04
- Apply Piotr Jaworski's patch (patch-r-status.diff) to update the
  catalog status when a backup job starts running.
24Jun04
- Add (char*) cast to readline call in console.c for old readlines.
- Copy Makefile.in from gnome2-console to gnome-console (to eliminate
  need for cats library).
- Modify spooling code to handle write error (e.g. spooling disk full)
  more gracefully. Previously despooling would fail.
22Jun04 
- Reduce casting in smartall.c a bit and add counters for 
  bytes, max_bytes, buffers and max_buffers.
- Fixed reload algorithm to stack both job end callback and the
  table id.
- Fixed the orphaned buffer after reload (job_end_push had to be
  destroyed.
- Destroy cond var (jcr->term_wait) only if initialized.
21Jun04
- Sort the Scheduled Jobs list by start-time, priority.
- Implement resources on a pointer.
- Fix Gnome console crash on up/down arrow with no history.
19Jun04
- Finish first cut of SIGHUP code. To make really work need res
  on a single pointer rather than in fixed memory.
- Fix a number of places in query.sql where multiple JobIds are
  printed (due to JobMedia records).
- Add new query: List jobs on Volume given Volume name.   
- Correct socket close on Win32 in bnet.c (in addition to compat.cpp).
  Caused fd leak in Win32 for each connection.
- Remove vol labeled test in askdir update_volume_info so that non-labeled
  Volume in catalog can be marked in error.
- Close socket in SD when connection rejected. Caused fd leaks.
- Initialize job_start_wait cond variable after every new_jcr() otherwise
  NetBSD gets error in library when trying to delete it without being inited.
- Fix typo (9 instead of 0) return status in write_new_volume_label.
- Fix mount.c to call routine that correctly marks a volume in error.
- Move code to rewrite volume label to subroutine -- a bit cleaner.
18Jun04
- Finish implementation and testing of new restore tree code.
- Implement feedback while tree is loading.
- Eliminate printing INFO message in UpdateDB (cats) -- it generates
  "false" error messages.
- Eliminate some GTK error messages when running the Gnome2 console.
16Jun04
- Begin restructuring tree.c for inclusion of the binary_insert()
  routine.         
- Apply Peter Eriksson's lib file order changes in linking for IRIX.
- Abort configure if Internal is  selected as the database.

15Jun04
- Applied another extern "C" patch from Peter Eriksson.
- Fixed a bunch of VC warning messages.
- Applied the patches sent by Andreas Jellinghaus: build Gnome and  
  wx-console in client-only build if configured; add ./configure option
  to permit setting of sbin modes -- default is 0745 as before; remove
  cats library from Gnome console build; remove old version from Gnome
  About box. Thanks Andreas.

- Applied Peter Eriksson's const changes to the source code. Thanks Peter.
- Implemented a binary_insert() method for dlists -- intended to be used
  in the restore tree routines.
- Turned on my bsscanf() code, which replaces sscanf() by my routines, which
  are a subset of sscanf() used by Bacula, but which have known 32/64 bit
  behavior rather than vendor dependent !@#$%*.
