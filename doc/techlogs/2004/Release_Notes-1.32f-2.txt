Release 1.32f-2
This release incorporates the 1.32f-1-weekofmonth and
the 1.32f-2-eom-nextvol patches. A Fedora Core build
define has been added and additional dependency
information has been added to the package Requires.
The virtual package names bacula-dir, bacula-sd and
bacula-fd have been added as Provides and the rescue
package now requires the bacula-fd which can be satisfied
either with the client package or either one of the
main packages.

*************************************************************
*This rpm release contains some important changes from 1.32d*
*************************************************************

The platform designator (rh7, rh8, rh9) has been
REMOVED from the package names as this was creating
some problems. Hence, you CAN NOT upgrade existing
1.32d installations with these packages (rpm -U).

To upgrade:
1. Backup your configuration files (/etc/bacula/*.conf)
"just to be safe."
2. Uninstall the old bacula package, ie.
rpm -e bacula-mysql-rh9
If you are not sure what package name is installed do
rpm -qa | grep bacula
3. Install the new package with rpm -i

In addition, the spec file has been reworked to include a
platform configuration section at the beginning of the file.
To rebuild the SRPM, first install using rpm -i then edit
/usr/src/redhat/SPECS/bacula.spec (or whatever directory
structure your platform uses) to set platform options and
select whether to build MySQL support. You can also pass
any of the defines on the command line as before.

*************************
*Future Platform Support*
*************************

RedHat 9 and perhaps 8 will continue to be supported for the
forseeable future. Whitebox Enterprise Linux support is
added with this release as I intend to migrate my server
(currently RH8) to that platform. Future releases will probably
add SuSE packages. I may also continue to provide RH8 packages 
by setting up a box for that purpose.

There is no intent to provide Fedora Core packages as neither
one of us wishes to get on that upgrade treadmill, however I
expect the SRPM will continue to build on that platform for some 
time. Anyone who is interested in building Fedora Core packages
please get in touch with me.

*****************************
*Rescue script package notes*
*****************************

This release officially includes the rescue package.
This package installs scripts for disaster recovery and 
builds rescue floppy disks for bare metal recovery. This 
package includes tomsrtbt (http://www.toms.net/rb/, by 
Tom Oehser, Tom@Toms.NET) to provide a tool to build a 
boot floppy disk. This package is platform independant as
it only includes shell scripts and a static file daemon.
The tomsrtbt package requires the libc5 compat libraries, 
available at
ftp://rpmfind.net/linux/contrib/libc6/i386/libc5-5.4.38-3.i386.rpm

You need to have the bacula-sqlite, bacula-mysql or 
bacula-client package for your platform installed and 
configured before installing this package. All of these
packages will supply the virtual package bacula-fd which is
a requirement for the rescue package.

After installing the scripts, rpm will run the getdiskinfo 
script to create the necessary information for your installation. 

To create a boot floppy using this information run
./make_rescue_disk --copy-static-bacula --copy-etc-files
from the /etc/bacula/rescue directory.

To recreate the disk information run
./getdiskinfo 
from the /etc/bacula/rescue directory.
