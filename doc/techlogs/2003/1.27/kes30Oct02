General:
- Alex found a problem with GZIP compression -- fixed.
- bacula stript fixes.
- Segment fault in Director fixed.
- Added openbsd to platforms

Changes submitted this submission:
- GZIP compression was broken for large files due to a variable that
  is changed during the compression. This was relatively easy to fix.
  However, there were a number of fixes required to make GZIP and SPARSE
  files work together. Found one more place in bextract where SPARSE_GZIP
  testing was missing.
- During testing of the above, I ran into the restore problem of multiple
  FileSet records. Fixed by including the FileSetId and the MD5 on the
  selection string, then always using the FileSetId. It is a bit
  confusing for the user, but ...
- Francis found a problem with bacula.in (fixed - thanks)
- I found another problem with bacula.in, so now it REALLY should work
  on most systems.
- Added the Replace options code for restores. Not tested.
- Fixed an ugly stack overrun bug in reading the config file
  that has been in for a long time.  I found this in testing on FreeBSD
  where the Director seg faulted.
