General:
- Did a number of cleanups of string copying to limit the length
  and prevent buffer overflows.

Changes submitted this submission:
- Added a mutex arount the gethostbyname() so that multiple simultaneous
  jobs get the correct address.
- Added the MaxVolJobs to the Media alter tables script for MySQL (forgot it).
- Changed arg to db_find_job_start_time to be POOLMEM for returning the string.
- Add the new VolUseDuration and MaxVolJobs to all the db_ routines.
- Use bstrncpy() in most places in the db_ routines to prevent a bad 
  database from crashing Bacula (self protection).

- Added the Bacula version to each job output so that I can more easily tell
  what version a user is running.
- Allowed commas to separate the options on an Include line. A subtle bug
  prevented this from working previously.
- Add Used to list of Volume Statuses that can be recycled.
- Make a single copy of mark_media_purged() in ua_purge.c
