General:
- Converted the manual over to a new format written in wml. This
  gives navigation buttons on the top and bottom of each page
  as well as a standard page size.
- Updated the main Web site, providing a menu bar to the left
  and much better organization and presentation of the information.
- Added code to recognize a Volume written with a larger block
  size than specified. The code automatically adjusts. 

Changes submitted this submission:
- Created a new scripts directory and moved most of the scripts
  previously in the main directory there. This cleans things up
  quite a bit.
- Moved the randpass stuff into autoconf.
- ensure that the generic make_bacula_tables and drop_bacula_tables
  are installed.
- Added code to filed to allow it to be run from inetd.  Just add the
  -i option.  I have not tested it.
