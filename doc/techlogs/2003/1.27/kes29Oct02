General:
- Major change to the bnet communications routines.

Changes submitted this submission:
- Modified the bacula script to use pid files, so this script should
  now work on more platforms.  Updated devel_bacula as well.
- Added the full GNU hostname on the configuration print output.
- Added gettimeofday() to configure, and tweaked a few variables for
  OpenBSD.
- Added a chapter to the manual on Porting Bacula to other platforms.
- Documented in Tips how to use the WriteBootstrap record.
- Modified bc_types.h to error if 64 bit types are not found.
- Pass replace option for restore to the FD (no code to use it yet).
- Modify the FD to pass back the GNU OS string as well as the DISTNAME
  and DISTVER. This needs to be put in the Client record in the catalog.
- Major reworking of the bnet routines to eliminate the zero length which
  previously indicated a signal. This risks to create some subtle communications
  bugs.  The changes now permit blank lines to be sent from the user to the
  Director.
- Found and corrected a few more places where the Win32 attributes were not
  being recognized.
- Permit spaces in the Where string (restore) by bashing/unbashing them.
- Handle quotes correctly in the Console program (actually Dir ua code).
  Previously they were not handled in the middle of a string.
- Corrected two error message (error reading file), which previously stated
  it was a network error.
- Reworked the files in the binary Windows release. Removed unused programs 
  and added a README with the copyright as suggested by John. Also added
  console.exe to the release.
- Found and corrected an autoloader mount problem where the wrong tape
  was specified.  Previously it looped, then gave up.  Now it correctly
  detects the volume is not correct and zaps the Slot in the catalog.
