General:
- Mostly Cygwin changes

Changes submitted this submission:
- Updated bdb_find.c to have new calling sequence for db_find_job_start_time
- dird/catreq.c edit in Volume name in error messages to SD
- attribs.c switch to using the cygwin API to convert from POSIX paths
  to Win32 paths. This now permits Win32 path specifications in Include
  statements (all combinations not yet tested).  It also avoids the large
  number of errors seen by Lutz if a Win32 path is specified in the Dir.
- Update testfind help and remove set_attribsEx debug code.      
- Build testfind as default.
- Turn off debug message in stored/askdir.c
