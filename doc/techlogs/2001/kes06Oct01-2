General:
- Fix segmentation fault on Solaris

Changes submitted this submission:
- Well, the user friendly printf of Linux gcc bites me again.
  (actually, it bit John). Linux printf so kindly prints %s
  of NULL pointers. Unfortunately this prevents detection of
  problems.          
  In this case, the JCR for the console program had never called
  the Storage daemon prior to contacting the File daemon, so it
  had a null pointer for the Storage daemon's authorization key,
  which isn't used in any case.
  Fixed by creating a dummy Storage daemon authorization key when
  the console's jcr packet is created.
- In testing this, I noticed that a really fatal error in bnet_open()
  such as being unable to resolve a name will cause bnet_open to retry,
  when it really should error -- to be fixed later.
- I added code to src/lib/Makefile.in to install the smtp program
  during "make install". Previously I had done this by hand.
