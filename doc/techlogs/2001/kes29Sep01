General:
- While installing Bacula at John's site, we found 
  a number of errors that this release fixes.

Changes submitted this submission:
- The configure.in script used relative paths incorrectly
  if no install program was available. Fixed by using
  absolute path on the AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIR().
- Fixed make clean to remove .in generated files in src/cats
- Removed a number of old unused files from src/cats
- Modified all the makefiles that install config files to
  leave any existing config file and create the new one
  as xxx.conf.new. This prevents existing config files
  from being overwritten by a "make install".
- Modified the code in file daemon backup.c to pass the
  path name of a directory with a trailing slash.
- Added a testfind program to src/findlib that will use
  Bacula's file algorithm to find a list of files. It also
  outputs a short summary of what it found and the number
  of file names that had to be truncated to 255 chars.
- In stored.c free the config file and shm only if they
  were allocated. This prevents trying to free a NULL
  pointer when doing ./stored -t
- Modified the code in src/cats/sql_create.c so that when
  adding the path and the file records, the path is always
  terminated with a slash. The file name now may be zero 
  length. Previously the filename was the last part of
  the path. Amazingly enough MySQL allows zero length
  string fields even though it is marked NOT NULL.
