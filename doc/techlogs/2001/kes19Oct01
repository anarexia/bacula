General:
- Mainly minor cleanups since last release.

Changes submitted this submission:
- Added FileSetId to Job record in SQL code (forgot last
  round and all testing was done on BDB).
- Added status command to File daemon.
- Modified daemons to print name, build date as the    
  first line of the status command.
- Enhanced (partially) the UA status command.

   status            with no args, does status of Director
   status storage    status of Storage daemon
   status client     status of Client daemon

- Tried to clean up the job termination code from
  the File daemon in the Director. Added code to implement
  cancelling of a job. Not tested.
- Added configured names to Director and Storage daemon
  (was previously done for file daemon).
- Added version command to console that prints the
  Director's version (not really needed as it is the
  first line that prints anyway).
- Fixed the new mailcommand directive in Message resources to
  work (I was picking it up on pass 2, but it was only available
  on pass 1 of the parser).
- Corrected a few possible references to null pointers in debug
  output in the message handler (Linux handles this, but Solaris
  crashes).
