General:

Changes submitted this submission:
- Allow the console to set the debug level in any or all of
  the daemons.
- Detect lchown in ./configure
- Automount after "label". This can be turned off. Default
  is on. If the volume is not automatically mounted, a message
  is printed to remind you to mount it.
- Additional details in the status output (name of current
  file being saved in File daemons).
- On Win32, the Status dialogue box now refreshes automatically
  every 5 seconds. Someday, I'll implement a "Preferences" dialog
  so that the refresh time can be set.
- The beginnings of platform dependent install code to allow
  automatic start of any or all the daemons.
- I'm just now upgrading to the latest version of CYGWIN, which
  reportedly does not have the recursive make SEGV problem and
  which should handle pthread_cancel() much better.
