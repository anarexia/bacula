General:
- The changes that added indexes to the SQLite database were
  lost -- thanks to Chuck for pointing this out. Redone.
- Fixed a problem quoting strings in SQLite. This showed up
  as database errors with files containing ' or " in the filename.
- Implemente restore command -- still in progress.

Changes submitted this submission:
- Added indexes to all fields in SQLite that exist in MySQL.
- Moved unused immortal files from src/lib to src/immortal.
  This will permit splitting depkgs.
- Started work on adding embedded MySQL. Cannot get the tables
  to work for the moment. Please don't try to use this option.
- Convert to using single quotes for enclosing all strings.
- Implement correct quoting algorithm for SQLite strings.
  Is dequoting needed?
- Started centralizing SQL statments in the Director in sql_cmds.c
- Changed a number of M_ABORTs to M_ERROR_TERM so that program terminates
  but does not produce a dump.
- Allow wild-card matches in bsr for Client name, and Job.
- Change OflineOnUnmount=no as default.
- Fixed improper printing of filenames containing a space in bls.c
  Thanks to Carlos for reporting this.
