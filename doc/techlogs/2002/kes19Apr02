General:
- DAT tape handling fix.
- Fixed WinNT hang problem.
- Applied Phil's patches.
- Some doc updates

Changes submitted this submission:
- Ensure that platforms Makefiles are called for clean  
  and distclean.
- Hide a lot of Makefile messages with @
- Applied Phil's configure.in patch. Thanks.
- Doc updates, many to clarify points brought up by Phil.
- Applied Phil's make_mysql_tables.in patch. Thanks.
- Made authenticate.c in dird test bnet_send status.
- Make label a bit more friendly with extra info message.
- Add level 200 to debug info in run command.
- Remove old code from findlib/testfind.c so that it compiles.
- Add two minute max wait to cram-md5 authentication. Hopefully,
  this will catch non-responding WinNT daemons.
- Allow time and size modifiers to be upper or lower case.
- Turn off old CYGWIN patch for pthread_cond_timedwait() bug that
  now causes File daemon hangs on WinNT.
- Fix mount messages for restore. Previous updates to save
  broke the restore code.
- By default write fixed block sizes rather than variable block
  sizes.  My Sony DAT simply does not work (reread failures) with
  variable block sizes.
- Data split across tapes was not being correctly restored
  (at least on DAT tapes). 
- Implement MaximumBlockSize and MinumBlockSize statements in
  Storage daemon so user can specify variable block sizes if
  desired.
- Return error if block checksum error on read (previously 
  ignored).
- Fixed some error messages in bls, and in some cases exit(1)
  rather than ABORT. There remain ABORTs to be examined.
- Made a local copy of tcpd.h and corrected the function 
  prototype problem for C++.
