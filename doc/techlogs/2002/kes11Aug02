General:
- Made restore actually work.

Changes submitted this submission:
- Made console and gconsole be configured (requested by Chuck)
- Updated kernstodo
- changed fs in Job record to fileset for clarity
- The console run command was not properly picking up the command
  line arguments.  Fixed!
- Changed add/remove/rm to mark/unmark
- Volume keyword VolumeName was wrong, changed to Volume (in restore bsr).
- Pass jcr to parse_bsr, and if non-NULL, it will output error messages
  to Job stream rather than Emsg.
- Modified lexical scanner to include caller context so that jcr can
  be stored in lex context allowing error messages to be properly 
  routed.
- Renamed the Job message chain to be jcr_msgs. This eliminated the      
  previous confusion with the default value, now named jcr->messages.
- Implemented multi-volume bsr records.    
- Implemented pm_strcat() and pm_strcpy() to cat/add to memory pool
  buffers in same way as strcat/strcpy, but expanding buffer.
- Modified db_get_volume_names to handle arbitrarily long Volume list.
