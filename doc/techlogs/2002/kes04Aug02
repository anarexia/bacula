General:
- Lots of work on the restore command.
- Take a stab at eliminating the "broken pipe message"
  when the console program prematurely terminates.

Changes submitted this submission:
- Reimplemented transactions for SQLite by keeping
  them all in the same thread.
- quit in the Console program now waits for Bacula to
  quit. To immediately quit, you must enter .quit
- Eliminated BNET_EOF -- this COULD have some negative consequences
  on interdaemon communications.
- Define Job termination status for Admin jobs.
- Write new bstrncpy() function that guarantees that strcpy is
  properly terminated.
- Fixed command input in ua_input.c to accept quoted items as a
  single field.
