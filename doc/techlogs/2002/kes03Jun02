General:
- Implemented GZIP compression
- Changed level to JobLevel (variable name)
- Create config.out that contains summary of ./configure
- Eliminate fcntl() locking of the console file and replaced
  it with a pthreads mutex.
- Note Director - SD protocol is changed to handle new tape
  information (Fileset, JobType, JobLevel).

Changes submitted this submission:
- Create config.out that contains a summary of ./configure
  to see what you previously configured: "cat config.out"
- Implemented GZIP compression.  Added addition syntax to
  Include { } resource to permit setting of any GZIP compression
  level:
     compression=GZIP
     compression=GZIP1
     ...
     compression=GZIP9

  Level 1 is minimum compression and level 9 is maximum. Using just
  GZIP gives the default (level 6).
- Enhanced the tape format to include the unique Job name, FileSetName,
  JobType, and JobLevel in the Start/End of Session records. The code
  detects that tape level difference and acts accordingly. You can 
  add data in the new format to old tapes.
- Fixed an incorrect display message in the prune command.
- Began implementation of Verify Volume and Verify Data.
- Cleaned up File daemon restore.c a bit ensuring that termination 
  cleanup is done and all possible Emsgs are converted to Jmsgs.
- Modify bls.c to use common setup routines. This reduced the big
  code duplication that creeped in when I added different listing
  options. Also, changing tapes is now handled uniformily in a subroutine.
