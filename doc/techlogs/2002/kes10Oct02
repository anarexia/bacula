General:
- Changed Job name conventions to avoid : which is an illegal
  character on Windows.

Changes submitted this submission:
- Added check for inet_pton to configure.in. If it does not
  exist (e.g. Windows) use inet_aton
- Documentation on GZIP.
- Another restore doc example.
- Documented btape fill command.
- Set default restore directory from /tmp to /tmp/bacula-restores
- Add additional no find error messages to sql_get.c
- Creating a bootstrap file on Windows failed because the Job name
  contained colons which are illegal on Windows. Replaced the
  colons with periods.  This corrects the Windows restore problem.
- Print number of files to be restored in "restore" command.
- On Windows systems, if there is a prefix, completely eliminate
  any drive: at the beginning of a path.
- Minor corrections to the tree routines to handle Windows
  files such as c:/ better. Previously it insisted on /c:/, which
  would then not be found in the catalog for a "dir" command.
- Modified cd command in restore to try /c: if c: fails.
- Add a new S_ISWIN32 bit to the st_mode word so that low level
  routines that create files do not print error messages.
- More work must be done to restore all Windows files correctly.
  Currently the following bits are not handled:
    Archive
    Hidden
    System 
  Also, all the dates are not properly restored.
