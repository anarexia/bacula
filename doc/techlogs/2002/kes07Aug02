General:

Changes submitted this submission:
- If the Console program terminated during the printing of messages,
  the message file was left locked. This was corrected by using the
  new read-write lock code.  
- Implemented Pw() and Vw() for obtaining and releasing a write lock
  using the rwl_xxx routines.
- Deleted some old pthread_mutex code from mysql.c
- In making the Irix port, I previously corrected the base64 routine so 
  they were not sensitive to the machine definition of char. This made
  them incompatible with previous versions invalidating MD5 signatures
  which are in base64 format. I have now corrected this, making the
  routines compatible with the previous version but also insensitive
  to the default definition of char.
- Removed some unnecessary NPRT() usage in signal.c (pointed out by
  the Irix compiler).
- Add back BNET_NONO for compatibility with older File daemons.
- Implement runing a restore Job in the restore command.
- Make installation of query.sql unconditional. To prevent you own file
  from being overwritten, give it a different name.
- Made parse_command_args() in ua take command from ua->cmd, this
  simplifies it and allows usage in other places -- e.g. building
  arguments for created run command in restore.
- Cleaned the naming of s_full_ctx to be s_jobids.
- Write the bsr created in restore to "working-directory"/restore.bsr
- Fix bugs in command line scanner in run command -- also some misplaced
  breaks!
- Eliminate static cmd in ua_server.c
- Eliminate segmentation fault when using the Run command in the
  Console -- forgot to init_msgs().
