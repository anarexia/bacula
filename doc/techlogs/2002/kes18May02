General:
- Implemented multiple Messages resource. Jobs may now have
  different messages resources.
- Implemented daemon pid files. This prevents multiple 
  daemons from running simultaneously. You can run multiple
  daemons if they listen on different ports.

Changes submitted this submission:
- Documented the Schedule resource a bit better.
- Began gently adding a POOLMEM type (perviously void).
  For the moment it is a #define to char, but long term
  it should be its own typedef.
- Corrected a bit of spacing on the status bar of gnome-console
- Added Admin and Archive Job types.
- Implemented multiple Messages resources. Each daemon has
  its own message resource, which defaults if not defined.
  Jobs may now have different message handlers.
- Cleaned up a bit of duplicate code in backup, verify, and
  restore by creating appropriate subroutines in job.c
- Added Type, Client, FileSet, and Level resource record
  definitions to the Director. These can be used in place
  of the Backup = ..., Verify = ..., ... commands.  This needs
  documenting.
- Corrected an incorrect message in the prune code and added
  the number of Files pruned in the message.
- Corrected several paint problems with gnome-console.
- Added a bit of printout in signal handler during traceback.
- Cleaned up most of sm_check() to be turned on/off by define
  in version.h
