General:
- Did a good amount of documentation.

Changes submitted this submission:
- Added sql_cmds.c to CVS, forgot, pointed out by Chuck.
- Added new platforms/irix directory to CVS
- Turn off transaction debug code in sql.c
- Reworked the scheduler so that it handles the same Job starting
  twice in the same hour. Previously it took one or the other.
- Tightened up the "slop" in the timings that I programmed to ensure
  that the same job isn't run twice or that no job was missed.
- Increase the sleep time.
- Used job_type_to_str() in status so that Admin jobs are correctly reported.
- Add internationalization message chars to a number of routines
  in util.c
- Make the watchdog timer clear the mutex when it exits.
- Some tweaks to the Restore command. It needs fixing when a Job spans
  two or more volumes.
