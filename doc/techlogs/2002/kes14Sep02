General:
- Better key generation on non OpenSSL systems.
- 64 bit file address support if available.
- Implement autochanger for reading
- Lots of cleanup of tape reading code.
- Automatically create all Pool resources when Bacula starts.
- Implement bscan.c
- Implement autochanger use via the Console commands "add" and "label"
- Begin implementation of a regression script 
- Write bootstrap after ever job

Changes submitted this submission:
- After noticing that the non OpenSSL random key generator was
  not good on Solaris, John wrote a very nice randpass generator.
- Integrated John's makeSessionKey for generating the FD->SD
  authorization.
- Statically link tools (doesn't work on Solaris).
- Document how to debug Bacula (new chapter in the manual)
- Remove unneeded printing of error message in sql_get.c
- Free SD description config record (previous oversight)
- Bash spaces when sending Director names, and unbash them when 
  received.
- Ensure no divide by zero in rate computation in backup.c
- Implement WriteBootstrap in backup.c
- Allow tape reading to request volume information for any
  volume.
- Create all Pool resources at startup.
- Show only Backup jobs in Restore listing of last 20 Jobs.
- Handle 64 bit stat packets in restore.
- Don't do shell expansion on store_dir in config if string 
  starts with |.  This is used for piping the program for the
  WriteBootstrap.
- Ignore SIGHUP -- DÈj‡Gnu was triggering this. 
- Implement autochanger for reading, many changes to 
  acquire_device_for_read()
- Implement callback for reading Volume. Implement in bextract,
  bls, and bscan.
- Implement bscan
- Add count to bsr.
- Fix Volume in bsr.
- Move autochanger code to new subroutine in mount.c
