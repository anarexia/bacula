General:
- Fixed several problems with filenames being truncated if
  they contain spaces. Thanks to the user that reported this.
- N.B. To get the new queries, after the "make" and 
  "make install" you must explicitly replace the
  existing query.sql by query.sql.new.  query.sql is a
  user configuration file, so it is not overwritten.
- Modified the M_TERM meaning to mean that Bacula has
  terminated in error without producing a dump. Previously,
  it meant that Bacula terminate (with or without error).
  You should remove any !terminate from your messages
  resources.

Changes submitted this submission:
- Changed the order of the libraries in the link so that
  tcp wrappers link properly. Thanks Phil for reporting this.
- A user reported that filenames containing spaces were truncated
  in bextract. This was indeed the case. They were also truncated
  in Restore as well as in Verify. They are, hopefully, all fixed
  now.
- Made a few error conditions in Verify non-fatal.
- Modified the Console "query" command to permit multiple SQL
  statements per command. 
- Implemented three new "query" options: 
    List last 10 Full Backups for a Client
    List Volumes used by selected JobId
    List Volumes to Restore All Files
  To use them, simply type "query" to the Console program, and
  select the one you want.
- Modified bextract to default to extracting all files (i.e. /).
- Cleaned up the code in bextract a bit.
