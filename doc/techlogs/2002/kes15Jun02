General:
- Implemented a Bootstrap file parser and matcher.
- Implemented first cut of bootstrap code in bextract  

Changes submitted this submission:
- Started clarifying different termination codes.
- Added M_ERROR_TERM to immediately terminate the daemon -- no dump.
  Also changed a few termination codes as appropriate.
- Fixed create_jobmedia_record() to include all the fields such as
  StartFile/EndFile, StartBlock/EndBlock.
- Print user friendly message when query mode ends.
- Fixed ls style print routines (bextract, bls, restore) to check
  buffer size, to print the link if any, and to used edit_uint64()
  instead of %lld.
- Moved scan_to_eol() and s_err() to lex.c to avoid dragging in 
  parse_conf.c for new bsr scanning code.
- New files: bsr.h, parse_bsr.c and match_bsr.c. parse_bsr.c parses
  a Bootstrap file, and match_bsr.c matches a bsr against a tape.
- use strcasecmp() in several places instead of lcase().
- Add first cut of bootstrap to bextract.
- Added File Size limit -- writes EOF after limit exeeded.
