General:
- Filled out the prune command a bit and did some testing.
- Make console accept redirected input.

Changes submitted this submission:
- Altered the Table definitions to include Recycle,
  FileRetention, JobRetention, and AutoPrune.
- Widened StartDay to 64 bits.
- Use JobId_t in more places. 
- Added the new table fields to the database record 
  definitions.
- Changed Recycle from string to a binary quantity.
- Added a Version table with a VersionId to detect 
  future changes in the database. This should prevent
  a Bacula from working with a database that is not in sync.
- Modify Console to accept input from a file. This will permit
  the .read command and allow reading a .rc file.
- Added new retention and recycle variables to the Director's
  configuration.
- The UA subroutines or commands can now be called from core
  code because the output routines detect the absence of a 
  UA socket and direct output to the Job.
- Added a verbose flage to the ua packet to permit reduction of
  output while running a UA command (prune) from a Job.
- Did a fair amount of work on the prune command. Prune Volume now
  works.
- Purge Volume now works.
