General:
- Additional config options for Console.
- Started adding code for Automatic Recycling of Volumes.
- Allow arbitrary length filenames in Verify code.
- Fix incorrect filename in Verify code.
- Significant enhancement to number scanning in config parser.
- Requires initializing MySQL tables, or applying cats/alter.sql
  to modify Media table.

Changes submitted this submission:
- Modified Makefile to printer a much more visible
  message if the make ends in error.
- Added the Purge value to the VolStatus in the Media table.
  This value is set if the Volume is purged.
- Enhanced the db_delete_media_record() routine to delete
  all associated records in the database.
- Modified Console to always write to the variable "output"       
  rather than stdout. This will permit directing output to a file.
- Enhanced the Console configuration file to have a Console 
  resource. This will allow us to add an rcfile and history
  file.
- Modified Find_next_vol in catreq.c to search for "Recycle"
  volumes if there are none marked Append. Also made Get_Vol_info
  return the VolStatus to the Storage daemon.
- Allow upper/lower case match on job level names.
- Added another warning message to the Console "delete media" 
  command.
- Corrected a number of FileId types from uint64_t to FileId_t in
  ua_retention.c.
- In ua server close database before freeing JCR (because pointer is
  kept in ua and jcr structures).
- parse all numbers as doubles. Do lots of checking for valid number
  formats. Allow numbers in scientific form (e.g. 1.5e+10).
- Remove terabyte modifier as it doesn't work in some compilers.
- Fix bug in handling some modifiers.
- Added all necessary code for Recycle to Storage daemon. A Volume
  marked Recycle will now be overwritten.
