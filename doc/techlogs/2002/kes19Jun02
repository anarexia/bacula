General:
- Improvements to the bootstrap compiler
- Implemented first cut of bootstrap code in the Storage daemon
- Modified the authentication code to be more explicit during 
  failures.

Changes submitted this submission:
- Added a few more debug message numbers with more arguments (Dmsg10, ...)
- Added more and more precise error messages when authentication fails.
- Implemented new "expect" codes in the lexical scanner that allows
  the caller to specify what he wants.                   
- Added integer, positive integer, 64 bit integer, and integer ranges,
  and name scanning to lex.
- Implemented new lex code in parse_conf.c, this reduces significantly
  the code.
- Hopefully fixed a watchdog race bug that caused the watchdog to time
  out a line after 1 hour rather than 6 days.
