General:
- More documentation.
- Implemented new fill command in btape that permits filling
  a tape and then reading it back to ensure that it works
  with Bacula.

Changes submitted this submission:
- Added ReadBytes to JCR, which contains Job bytes read by
  FD, JobBytes contains compressed output of FD.
- Modified FD to pass back JobStatus, ReadBytes, JobBytes, ...
  for backup jobs.  This is upward compatible.
- Modified backup termination status report to contain the
  compression ratio 100 * (1 - compressed-bytes/uncompressed-bytes)
  This will always be zero if no software compression was
  done, or if you are using a version 1.25 or older FD.
- Pickup Job termination status of FD in backup, so now
  the termination status represents the state of all three
  daemons.
- Implemented new fill command in btape that permits filling
  a tape and then reading it back to ensure that it works
  with Bacula.
- Modified the default restore directory to be /tmp/bacula-restores
  rather than /tmp. This is because if you restore / into /tmp, 
  Bacula will reset /tmp with the permissions of /, which is 
  most likely not what you want.  This way, only bacula-restores
  gets modified -- thanks to William Lewis Brown for pointing this
  out.
