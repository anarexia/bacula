General:
- Modified immortal.w and filesys.w to compile correctly
  on Win32.


Changes submitted this submission:
- Changed header files in immortal.w and filesys.w to
  use bacula.h and in the case of filesys.w to include
  the findlib/find.h and findlib/system.h headers. 
- Modified filesys.w to use the S_IFMT, ... defines
  rather than the __S... defines since on Win32, the
  __S defines are actually _S 
- Put back a few uint32_t for JobId in place of the
  unsigned ints.
