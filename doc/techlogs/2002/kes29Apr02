General:
- Prune and Purge commands mostly completed, but
  not tested.

Changes submitted this submission:
- Removed GNOME about box and replaced it with 
  a somewhat crude Gtk+ about box in the gnome-console.
- Widened StartDay in the Job DB record to be 64 bits.
- Changed edit_uint_ to edit_uint64_ everywhere. Much more
  descriptive of what is done.
- Removed most llds and replaced them with %s and edit_uint64.
  This makes the code a bit easier to read for beginners.
- Added a btime_t typedef which is 64 bits wide.
- Added most of the code needed to do Purge and Prune of
  database. Not yet tested. Please do not use.
