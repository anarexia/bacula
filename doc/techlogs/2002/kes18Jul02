General:
- The following two changes were prompted by questions/suggestions
  from A Morgan.

Changes submitted this submission:
- If you have "AlwaysOpen = no" in your SD Device
  resource, Bacula will free() the drive when it
  is finished with the Job.
- If you have "Offline On Unmount = yes", in your
  SD Device resource, Bacula will offline (or eject)
  the tape prior to freeing it.
- Added Maximum Open Wait to allow open() to wait if drive is busy.
- Added RunBeforeJob and RunAfterJob records to Job records.
  This permits running an external program with the following editing
  codes:
    %% = %
    %c = Client's name
    %d = Director's name
    %i = JobId
    %e = Job Exit
    %j = Job
    %l = Job Level
    %n = Job name
    %t = Job type
