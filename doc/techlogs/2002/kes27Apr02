General:
- Fixes to Verify when only MD5 differs.
- Make gnome-console display messages every five seconds.

Changes submitted this submission:
- Insert 0 for MD5 as default rather than space.
- Allow .messages "transparent" command while reading input
  in UserAgent server.
- In dird/verify.c ensure that correct filename is printed if only
  the MD5 differs. Minor reindenting caused large diff.
- Delete unused code from backup.c
- In filed/verify.c ensure that same algorithm as backup.c is used
  to pass back MD5 signatures -- especially for directories and files
  that cannot be read. Change dummy filename from X to *MD5-id*.
  This dummy value should never be printed.
- Make gnome-console poll Director every 5 seconds for output.
  This means that queued up messages are displayed at reasonable
  intervals. Delete some unused code hanging around from the tty
  console program.
