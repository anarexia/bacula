General:
- Implemented first major cut of bscan -- program to scan a tape
  and recreate a Bacula catalog.
- Fixed lseek() relative negative seek that prevented writing multiple
  jobs to a File volume.
- Implemented BB02 tape format -- currently turned off for writing.

Changes submitted this submission:
- Updated README
- Implemented new BB02 tape format, which moves the VolSessionId and
  VolSessionTime from the record headers into the Block header.  It
  is currently turned off.
- Implemented new btime time/date format on the tape. This is currently
  turned off.
- Added JobStatus to EOS tape label. This is currently turned off.
- Changed start_block, ... to StartBlock in JCR for uniformity.
- Print a message telling which tables were dropped/made with  
  ./drop_bacula_tables.
- Return JobType and JobLevel in db_get_job_record().
- Implemented get_current_btime(), which returns btime_t.
- Bump debug message max size to 2000 bytes.
- Add btime_t serial/unserial routines.
- Rework all tape label routines to integrate btime and other
  label format changes (currently turned off -- for writing).
- Fix lseek() to always be positive -- block.c
- Consolidate record, block, and label major #defines in block.h.
- Major implementation of bscan. Some more minor tweaking will be
  necessary.  E.g. add multiple records for multiple simultaneous
  Jobs.
- Cleanup lseek() to always use off_t as second argument.
- Add new "created" tape label (EOT_LABEL). This generates a callback
  to the read_records() routine when the final end of all tapes is
  reached allowing proper termination and updating of the media records.
