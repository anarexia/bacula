General:
- Made last changes for integrating prune and purge commands.

Changes submitted this submission:
- Add -ltermcap to CONS_LIBS when readline is configured.
  More work to be done to search for termcap.
- Added cats/drop_sqlite_tables.in, which will delete the
  SQLite database.
- Got CWEB working so that we can compile filesys.w and immortal.w
- Modified depkgs to include cweb.             
- Note, CWEB is not yet used by the core Bacula code.
- Made cats/alter.sql, which alters an old database to bring it
  up to the new format. This only works with MySQL since SQLite does
  not have the ALTER SQL command.
- Changed the old StartDay field in the db to be JobTDate, which is
  the latest time/date in widened Unix time format that the Job ran.
  This value is used when doing pruning.
- Added code in cats/sql.c to verify that the database internal version
  corresponds to the db version compiled in Bacula. It is set to 1 currently.
- Lots of changes to cats to bring the SQL up to date with the new 
  retention period changes.
- Added Console command code to permit changing a Volume's retention
  period.
- Removed old code that used date_encode() and replaced it with widened
  Unix time().
- Started modifying Message resource scanner so that we can have multiple
  message resources. Much more work to be done.
- Moved scanning for time into new library routine string_to_btime().
