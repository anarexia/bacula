General:
- Added .cvsignore files in each directory to cut down on the
  CVS output when scanning directories and finding Makefiles
  and such which are not part of the CVS tree.

Changes submitted this submission:
- Cleaned up a lot of the error messages in Verify, including
  indenting.
- Had to remove some of the "automatic" error message printing
  in the DB because they are in fact things that come up 
  for Verify but not really errors.
